<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap p-left">In issuing my present work I have two distinct personal duties to
perform, and I hasten, in these few brief lines of introduction, to
discharge them. First, I earnestly desire to ask indulgence from my
readers for any shortcomings which may be apparent in its contents;
and next, I desire emphatically to express my thanks to all who have
in any way, or even to the smallest extent, assisted me in my labours.
The preparation of the work has extended over a considerable period
of time, and I have had many difficulties to contend with that are,
and must necessarily be, wholly unknown to any but myself—hard
literary digging to get at facts and to verify dates, that is not
understood, and would scarce be believed in, by the reader who turns
to my pages—and hence errors of omission and of commission may have,
nay, doubtless have crept in, and may in some places, to a greater or
less extent, have marred the accuracy of the page whereon they have
occurred. I can honestly say I have left nothing undone, no source
untried, and no trouble untaken to secure perfect accuracy in all I
have written, and yet I am painfully aware that shortcomings may, and
doubtless will, be laid to my charge; for these, wherever they occur,
I ask, and indeed claim, indulgence. I believe in <i>work</i>, in hard
unceasing labour, in patient and painstaking research, in untiring
searchings, and in diligent collection and arrangement of facts—to
make time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span> and labour and money subservient to the end in view, rather
than that the end in view, and the time and labour and money expended,
should bend and bow and ultimately break before <i>time</i>. Thus it is
that my “Ceramic Art” has been so long in progress, and thus it is that
many changes have occurred during the time it has been passing through
the press which it has been manifestly impossible to chronicle.</p>

<p>I have the proud satisfaction, however, of knowing that my work is the
only one of its kind yet attempted, and I feel a confident hope that it
will fill a gap that has long wanted filling, and will be found alike
useful to the manufacturer, the china collector, and the general reader.</p>

<p>When, some twenty years ago, at the instance of my dear friend Mr. S.
C. Hall, I began my series of papers in the <i>Art Journal</i> upon
the various famous earthenware and porcelain works of the kingdom,
but little had been done in that direction, and the information I
got together from time to time had to be procured from original
sources, by prolonged visits to the places themselves and by
numberless applications to all sorts of people from whom even scraps
of reliable matter could be obtained. Books on the subject were not
many, and the information they contained on English Ceramics was
meagre in the extreme. Since then numerous workers have sprung up, and
their published volumes—many of them sumptuous and truly valuable
works—attest strongly to the interest and pains they have taken in
the subject. To all these, whoever they may be, the world owes a debt
of gratitude for devoting their time and their talents to so important
a branch of study. To each of them I tender my own thanks for having
devoted themselves to the elucidation of one of my favourite pursuits,
and for having given to the world the result of their labours. No work
has, however, until now been entirely devoted to the one subject of
British Ceramics, and I feel therefore that in presenting my present
volumes to the public I am only carrying out the plan I at first laid
down, and am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span> not even in the slightest degree encroaching on the
province of any other writer.</p>

<p>I think I may safely say there is scarcely a manufacturer—even if
there be one at all—in the length and breadth of the kingdom with
whom I have not frequently communicated in the progress of this work.
Except in some few solitary instances I have received the information I
have sought, and my inquiries have met with the most cordial and ready
response.</p>

<p>To all those who have thus assisted me with information or otherwise,
and especially to my friend Mr. Goss, who has greatly assisted me
over the onerous task of some of the Staffordshire potteries, I offer
my warmest thanks; and to those few others, who from inattention,
shortsightedness, or other cause, have not responded to my inquiries, I
would express my sorrow if, through that inattention on their part, I
have been unable to give as full particulars regarding their potteries
as I could have wished. To thank by name those who have assisted
me with information would require a long list indeed; I therefore
tender my acknowledgments to all in the one emphatic good old English
expression—“<i>Thank you!</i>”</p>

</div>


<p>The history of the ceramic art in our own country is one of intense
interest and of paramount importance. I open my present work, which I
intend to devote to its consideration, with this assertion, and before
it is done I hope I shall have proved its truth.</p>

<p>It is a subject which may be treated in more ways than one. It may
be considered technically, <i>i.e.</i> with regard to manipulation,
to the mixing of bodies and glazes, and the practical parts of the
potter’s art; or historically, so as to treat of the introduction
and progress of the art in this country, its gradual extension and
improvement, the chief seats of its operations, and the characteristics
of the productions of each age and place. To neither of these do I
purpose confining myself; but to the latter I shall, here and there,
mix up just sufficient of the former to render it more intelligible
and useful. The main ingredients of the “body”—to use a potter’s
term—of my work will be history, description, and biography, with just
sufficient technicology to temper it and give it its proper tenacity
and consistency. For the facts relating to the earliest examples of
that art, from which I shall deduce my narrative, I rely upon actual
researches into grave-mounds and otherwise, undertaken by myself or
by others; and for the rest—those relating to the art in mediæval
and later times—upon constant inquirings and searchings and readings
carried on, with this special end in view, during the course of many
years.</p>

<p>It is impossible to show when the potter’s art was first invented or
when it was first brought into use in this island; but that it was
practised here in the very earliest days of its being inhabited by
its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span> savage population can be abundantly proved. To this pre-historic
period, then, I shall first direct attention; and then endeavour to
trace the history of the art down from the Celtic to the Romano-British
period; from the time of the Romans to the Anglo-Saxons and Normans;
and so gradually come downwards through mediæval to modern times,
giving, under each separate seat of the more modern manufacture,
historical notices of the works and their founders, and descriptive
particulars of the more characteristic of their productions.</p>

  </div>

<p>The practice of the fictile art in England dates back, as I have
already said, to a very remote period—that of its Celtic or ancient
British population, by whom there is abundant evidence it was much
esteemed. It is pleasant to know, and to be able indisputably to
prove, that from those early days down to the present time the art
has, through a long succession of ages, continued with more or less
skill, to be observed among us, and that thus in pottery, as in nothing
else, an unbroken chain, connecting us in our present high state of
civilisation with our remote barbarian forefathers of the stone age,
exists. The weapons and other implements of imperishable stone and
flint have, long ages ago, died out, and any possible connection
between them and the weapons or tools of our own day has died with
them; but the vessels of simple clay have an abiding-place with us
which has lasted without a break until now, and will yet last for ever.
Hitherto the course of the potter’s art has been one of constant and
gradual improvement; but its capabilities for further development are
almost unbounded, and another generation will witness advances of which
we can now but dimly dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span></p>

<p>Among the ancient Britons, vessels of clay were formed for sepulchral
and other uses, and it is entirely to their grave-mounds that we are
indebted for the examples which have survived to our time. It is in
the course of examination of these mounds that these fictile remains
have been brought to light; and it is by a careful examination of these
alone, and by constant comparison of the “finds” of one locality with
the discoveries of another, that a proper estimate of their character
has been, or can be, drawn.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image003a">

  </div>

<p>The pottery of this period may be safely arranged in four classes<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>,
viz.—1. <i>Sepulchral</i> or <i>Cinerary Urns</i>, which have been
made for and have contained, or been inverted over, calcined human
bones; 2. <i>Drinking Cups</i>, which, in a similar manner, are
supposed to have contained some liquid to be placed with the dead
body; 3. <i>Food Vessels</i> (so called), which are supposed to have
contained an offering of food, and which are more usually found
with unburnt bodies than along with interments by cremation; 4.
<i>Immolation Urns</i>, (erroneously called <i>Incense Cups</i> by Sir
R. Colt Hoare for want of more knowledge of their use), which are very
small vessels, found only with burnt bones (and usually also containing
them), placed in the mouths of, or close by, the larger cinerary urns.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
These latter I believe to have been simply small urns intended to
receive the ashes of the infant, perhaps sacrificed at the death of its
mother, so as to admit of being placed within the larger urn containing
the ashes of the parent: I venture, therefore, to name them “Immolation
Urns.”</p>

<p>No notice of the pottery of this period is to be found in ancient
writers, if we except the allusion of Strabo,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> who says that one of
the commodities with which the Phœnicians traded to the Cassiterides
was earthenware. But in connection with this it is necessary to state
that no example of pottery which can possibly be traced to Phœnician
origin has as yet been found in any of the hundreds of barrows which
have been opened.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image004a">
     <img
    class="p1"   
    src="images/image004a.jpg"

     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center sm">Fig. 5.—Tresvenneck.</p>
  </div>

<p>The pottery exhibits considerable difference, both in clay, in size,
and in ornamentation. Those presumed to be the oldest are of coarse
clay mixed with small pebbles and sand; the later ones of a somewhat
less clumsy form, and perhaps a finer mixture of clays. They are
entirely wrought by hand without the assistance of the wheel, and are
mostly very thick and clumsy. They are very imperfectly fired, having
probably been baked on the funeral pyre.</p>

<p>In the examination of barrows of this period it not unfrequently
happens that the spot where the funeral pyre has been lit can very
clearly be perceived. In these instances the ground beneath is
generally found to be burned to some considerable depth; sometimes,
indeed, it is burned to a fine red colour, and approaches in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span> texture
somewhat to that of brick. Where it was intended that the remains
should be placed in an urn for interment, it appears, from careful
examinations which have been made, that the urn being formed of
clay—most probably, judging from the delicacy of touch, and from the
impress of fingers which occasionally remains, by the females of the
tribe—and ornamented according to the taste of the manipulator, was
placed in the funeral fire and there baked, while the body of the
deceased was being consumed. The remains of the calcined bones, the
flints, &amp;c., were then gathered up together, and placed in the urn;
over which the mound was next raised.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image005">

    class="p1"   
    src="images/image005.jpg"
     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center sm">Fig. 6.—Trentham.</p>
  </div>

<p>From their imperfect firing, the vessels of this period are usually
called “sun-baked” or “sun-dried;” but this is a grave error, as any
one conversant with examples cannot fail, on careful examination,
to see. If the vessels were “sun-baked” only, their burial in the
earth—in the tumuli wherein, some two thousand years ago, they were
deposited, and where they have all that time remained—would soon
soften them, and they would, ages ago, have returned to their old
clayey consistency. As it is, the urns have remained of their original
form, and although, from imperfect baking, they are sometimes found
partially softened, they still retain their form, and soon regain their
original hardness. They bear abundant evidence of the action of fire,
and are, indeed, sometimes sufficiently burned for the clay to have
attained a red colour—a result which no “sunbaking”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span> could produce.
They are mostly of an earthy brown colour outside, and almost black in
fracture, and many of the cinerary urns bear internal and unmistakable
evidence of having been filled with the burnt bones and ashes of the
deceased, while those ashes were of a glowing and intense heat. They
were, most probably, fashioned by the females of the tribe, on the
death of their relative, from the clay to be found nearest to the spot,
and baked on or by the funeral pyre. The glowing ashes and bones were
then, as I have already stated, collected together, and placed in the
urn, and the flint implements, and occasionally other relics belonging
to the deceased, deposited along with them. In some instances, however,
it is probable that even the cinerary urns were burned in a separate
fire, as were the “drinking cups,” which are usually fired to a much
harder degree than they are. No kiln, or anything approaching to one,
however, could of course have been used.</p>

<p>The <i>Cinerary</i> or <i>Sepulchral Urns</i> vary very considerably
in size, in form, in ornamentation, and in material—the latter,
naturally, depending on the locality where the urns were made; and, as
a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span> general rule, they differ also in the different tribes. Those which
are supposed to be the most ancient, from the fact of their frequently
containing flint instruments along with the calcined bones, are of
large size, ranging from nine or ten, to sixteen or eighteen inches
in height. Those which are considered to belong to a somewhat later
period, when cremation had again become general, are of a smaller size,
and of a somewhat finer texture. With them objects of flint are rarely
found, but articles of bronze are occasionally discovered. Sometimes
they are wide at the mouth, without any overlapping rim; at others they
are characterised by a deeply overlapping lip or rim; others are more
of “flower-pot” form, with encircling raised bands, while others again
are contracted inwardly at the mouth by curved rims. Some also have
loops at the sides. The ornamentation is produced chiefly by incised
lines, or punctures, or by lines, &amp;c., produced by indenting into the
soft clay a twisted thong (Fig. <a href="#image014a">37</a>). Encircling and zig-zag lines of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
various forms, reticulated and lozenge-formed patterns, and rows of
indentations, are the usual decorations; but occasionally, as at West
Kennet and Launceston Heath, clearly defined patterns are produced by
the finger or thumb nail.</p>

<p>The more usual of the forms will be best understood by the engraved
examples, selected from the proceeds of many barrow openings in
different parts of the kingdom.</p>

<p>The four urns (Fig. <a href="#image003a">2</a>, <a href="#image003b">3</a>, <a href="#image004a">4</a>, and <a href="#image005">6</a>) are characteristic examples of the
variety with the broad or deep overlapping border or rim. The first of
these has the pattern incised in the soft clay, that on the rim being
in diagonal lines, and the central portion reticulated. The second has
the herring-bone or chevron ornament around its rim, and the third
example is ornamented with horizontal and vertical lines alternately on
its rim, and zig-zagged, filled in with horizontal and crossed, lines
on the central part. The lines in this are all produced by indenting
a twisted thong into the clay while in a soft state. Fig. <a href="#image009a">16</a> has its
ornamentation indented with twisted thongs in “herring-bone” pattern
both on the outside and inside the rim and around the central part.
Fig. <a href="#image006b">8</a> has a central band as well as overhanging lip. Figs. <a href="#image008a">11</a> and <a href="#image008c">13</a>,
from Dorsetshire barrows,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> are of different form, the ornamentation
consisting of incised lines and impressed thumbmarks, &amp;c. The remaining
engravings also give excellent examples of other forms and varieties of
these sepulchral vessels. Figs. <a href="#image077a">9</a> and <a href="#image077b">10</a> have the upper part curved,
and almost approaching to cup shape, and Fig. <a href="#image006a">7</a> has raised bands; in
Fig. <a href="#image008d">14</a> the upper parts are hollowed out; and in Fig. <a href="#image008e">15</a> the upper part
is marked with lozenges. Figs. <a href="#image010">19</a> and <a href="#image011b">23</a> are ornamented with indented
dots produced by pressing the end of a stick or other substance into
the soft clay. Fig. <a href="#image011b">23</a> has these dots in zig-zag lines.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#image010">21</a> has the reticulated lines produced by indentations from twisted
thongs. Fig. <a href="#image011a">22</a> is a remarkably fine example. Around its upper portion
are encircling lines, between which is the usual zig-zag ornament.
Around the central band, too, are encircling lines, between which are
a series of vertical zig-zag lines. The whole of the ornamentation has
been produced by twisted thongs; some, however, being of tighter twist
than others. Inside, the rim is ornamented by encircling and diagonal
lines. It has on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span> its central band four projecting handles or loops,
which are pierced. Nine other looped examples, from Cornwall, are shown
on Figs. <a href="#image004b">5</a>, <a href="#image009b">17</a>, <a href="#image012a">24</a>, <a href="#image012b">25</a>, <a href="#image012c">26</a>,

<p>The <i>Drinking Cups</i> are usually of tall form, globular in the
lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span> half, contracted in the middle, and expanding at the mouth.
In ornamentation they are more elaborate than the cinerary urns,
many of them, in fact, being covered over their entire surface with
impressed or incised patterns, frequently of considerable delicacy in
manipulation, and always of a finer and higher quality than those of
the other descriptions of pottery. Figs. <a href="#image014c">39 to 48</a> will show some of the
varieties both of form and style of decoration. Instances have been
known in which a kind of incrustation has been very perceptible on
the inner surface, thus showing that their use as vessels for holding
liquor is certain; the incrustation being produced by the gradual
drying up of the liquid with which they had been filled when placed
with the dead body.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#image016c">47</a>, which, however, may perhaps be a food vessel, has the unusual
feature of being ornamented on the bottom quite as elaborately as
around its sides. The bottom is shown on Fig. <a href="#image017a">48</a>. The whole of the
ornamentation has been produced by the indentation of twisted thongs
into the pliant clay.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#image014c">39</a>, from Fimber, is richly and elaborately ornamented over its
entire surface with the most delicate indentations, and is (with Fig.
<a href="#image015b">42</a>) one of the best and most perfect of known examples. When found
it stood close to the shoulders of the skeleton of a strong-boned,
middle-aged, man, which lay on the right side. Fig. <a href="#image015b">42</a> is equally as
elaborate in ornamentation, and as good in form. Like the former, it
is ornamented by thong indentations. Fig. <a href="#image015a">41</a> is of the same general
shape, but not so elaborate in design; the greater portion of the
ornamentation consisting of reticulated and lozenge patterns. Fig.
<a href="#image016a">45</a> is also a remarkably good example, and is about equal in point of
ornament with Fig. <a href="#image016b">46</a>. Fig. <a href="#image014d">40</a> is of very different form, as are also
Figs. <a href="#image015c">43</a> and <a href="#image015d">44</a>. The ornamentation on the first of these is produced in
the usual way, and on the second, by simple indentations. Other forms
of drinking cups are met with, but these are the most usual.</p>

<p>The <i>Food Vessels</i>—small urns, so called because they were
probably intended to contain an offering of food—are of various forms
and sizes, and are, in point of decoration, more or less elaborate.
They are usually small at the bottom, and gradually swell out until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
they become, frequently, wider at the mouth than they are in height.
They are formed of clay of much the same kind as the other vessels,
and are fired to about the same degree of hardness. Figs. <a href="#image">49 to 57</a>
will show their general form and style of decoration. Figs. <a href="#image017b">49</a> and <a href="#image017c">50</a>
were found in the same barrow, and yet, as will be seen, exhibit very
different styles of ornamentation. The first of these is four and three
quarter inches in height, and five and a half inches in diameter at the
top. It is richly ornamented with the usual diagonal and herring-bone
lines, formed by twisted thongs impressed into the soft clay, in its
upper part. Around the body of the urn itself, however, is a pattern
of lozenge form, very unusual on vessels of this period. The second is
five and a quarter inches in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span> height, and six and a quarter inches in
diameter at the top. It is very richly ornamented.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#image018b">53</a> has the pattern rudely indented over its whole surface. Fig.
<a href="#image017d">51</a> is coarse and rude, and the pattern very simple. Figs. <a href="#image019a">54</a>, <a href="#image019b">55</a>, and
<a href="#image019d">57</a> are of different character, and have a kind of handle or projecting
stud on four sides. They are among the most elaborate, in point of
ornamentation, of any of these interesting vessels, of which other
forms besides those engraved have occasionally been found. On Wykeham
Moor, in Yorkshire the Rev. Canon Greenwell has brought to light some
urns of a different character, and of greater width at the mouth.</p>

<p>The diminutive vessels, usually called (though, as I have said,
erroneously) “Incense Cups,” but which I propose to call “<i>Immolation
Urns</i>,” are ornamented in the same manner as the other pottery.
The form, as will be seen from Figs. <a href="#image020a">58 to 75</a>, varies much, from a
plain salt-cellar like cup to the more elaborately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span> rimmed vase. Three
examples (Figs. <a href="#image020k">68</a>, <a href="#image020m">70</a>, and <a href="#image022c">75</a>) have the very unusual appendage of
a handle at one side; others have holes in their sides, as if for
suspension, and I suspect this has been the case in the urn containing
the ashes of the mother. Fig. <a href="#image020j">67</a> has four handles.</p>

<p>Holes for, as supposed, suspension, are shown in Figs. <a href="#image020a">58</a>, <a href="#image021a">72</a>, and <a href="#image022a">74</a>;
these have each two of these small perforations in the side. Others, as
in Figs. <a href="#image020g">64</a> and <a href="#image020j">67</a>, have perforated loops at their sides. Fig. <a href="#image020h">65</a> is
of unusual form, having a broad rim round its mouth; it is elaborately
ornamented. Figs. <a href="#image004b">5</a>, <a href="#image010">18</a> and <a href="#image010">20</a> are shown with the urns with which they
were found.</p>

<p>Other forms of these interesting little vessels, which generally range
from an inch and a half to three inches in height, occur. They will
be best understood from the engravings. One of these (Fig. <a href="#image021a">72</a>), for
the purpose of showing its pattern more carefully, is engraved of its
<span class="allsmcap">FULL SIZE</span>. It is a remarkable example, and has its bottom
ornamented as well as its sides and rim, which are shown on Figs. <a href="#image021b">73</a>
and <a href="#image022a">74</a>. When found it was filled with burnt bones, probably of an
infant. On one side were two perforations.</p>

<p>Among the unusual forms of Celtic pottery may be named the curious
examples (Figs. <a href="#image023a">76</a> and <a href="#image023b">77</a>) one of which is a kind of drinking mug with
a handle, and the other is supported on feet. Fig. <a href="#image023a">76</a>, and another
of somewhat similar kind in the Ely Museum, are the only two known
examples of this form of vessel, and they will be seen to be very
richly ornamented.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span> Fig. <a href="#image023a">76</a> is in the Bateman collection, as is also
Fig. <a href="#image023b">77</a>. It is one of the class of vessels hitherto called incense
cups, and is, I believe, unique—no other example on feet having come
under my notice.</p>

<p>During the Romano-British period the fictile art was much practised in
England, and not only was a large variety of wares produced, but an
almost endless number of vessels were made. Potworks were established
in many parts of the kingdom, some of which grew to very large
dimensions, while others of a less important character and size still
made wares of extremely good quality. The three principal potteries—at
least so far as present researches have enabled us to judge—in England
at this period were those on the Medway, in the Upchurch marshes,
extending towards Sheerness, in Kent; the Durobrivian potteries on
the river Nen, in Northamptonshire; and the Salopian potteries on the
Severn, in Shropshire. Smaller pot works, however, being scattered over
various parts of the kingdom.</p>

<p>With the well-known “Samian Ware,” the finest and most beautiful of
the pottery of the Romans which is found in this country, I have,
of course, nothing to do in my present work; for, although found so
frequently and so abundantly in England, it was not manufactured here,
and therefore does not come within its scope. I proceed, therefore, to
speak of the various English seats of the manufacture.</p>

<p><i>Upchurch Ware.</i>—The district wherein this pottery was made and
is found so abundantly, is of five or six miles in length, and from
one to two in breadth; and over the whole of this tract of country,
at a distance of some few feet below the surface, a regular layer of
remains of Roman fictile art occurs. To Mr. C. Roach Smith is due the
greatest credit of bringing these under notice:—“There can be no
doubt,” says Mr. Wright, “not only from the extent of ground covered by
the potteries, but from the frequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span> occurrence of the sort of pottery
made here, among Roman remains in Britain belonging to different
periods, that these potteries were in full activity during the whole
extent of the Roman period. The site of the kilns was moved as the clay
was used up, and at the same time the refuse pottery was thrown on the
ground behind them, so that, when at last abandoned, this extensive
site presented a surface of ground covered almost entirely by a bed of
refuse pottery.” Here, then, the Roman <i>figuli</i> exercised, more
extensively than anywhere else in England their art, and continued its
practice for a long series of years. In those days the ground would of
course be firm and dry. Since then, as is usually the case in so long
a number of years, the soil has accumulated to the thickness of about
three feet—the inroads which the Medway is constantly making upon it
forming the creeks, and continually disclosing the remains left by the
potters.</p>

<p>The ware made at Upchurch must have been in considerable repute, for
it is found in Roman localities in most parts of the kingdom. On
Roman sites in France and Germany and in Flanders, &amp;c., wares of a
precisely similar kind are found, and show that it is probable they
were simultaneously made at different places. The prevailing colour
of the ware is a bluish or greyish black, with a smooth and rather
shining surface. A good deal, however, is of a dark drab colour. The
black colour has been produced by the process of “firing” in “smother
kilns”—a process well known to potters. The forms of the vessels,
as well as the sizes, vary to a surprising extent, but they are all
remarkable for the gracefulness and elegance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span> of their outline, and,
in many instances, for the simplicity and effective character of the
patterns with which they are decorated. The decorations consist chiefly
of circles or semi-circles; lines, vertical or otherwise; bands, and
numbers of raised dots arranged in a variety of ways. The clay used is
fine, and the vessels are light and thin, and remarkably well “potted.”</p>

<p>The instruments used in the ornamentation of this pottery appear to
have been of a very rude description, and were, as it seems, chiefly
mere sticks, some sharpened to a point, and others with a transverse
section cut into notches. The former were used in tracing the lines
already described; the latter had the section formed into a square or
rhomboid, the surface of which was cut into parallel lines crossing
each other so as to form a dotted figure, and this was stamped on
the surface of the pottery in various combinations and arrangements.
Sometimes these dots are arranged so as to form bands;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
others simply “patch” ornaments. Other vessels were covered with
reticulation, the lines being simply scratched into the surface of the
clay; and others have bands of serrated lines.</p>

<p>The forms of some of the vessels from the Upchurch works will be seen
on Fig. <a href="#image025">78</a>, and a series of other characteristic examples are given on
Figs. <a href="#image026a">79 to 95</a>.</p>

<p>One example (Fig. <a href="#image026a">80</a>) is ornamented with half-circles traced on the
clay as with compasses, from which run downwards rows of incised lines.
On Fig. <a href="#image025">78</a> is an example of much the same character of ornamentation

with raised dots in bands and patches; while <a href="#image026a">83</a> and <a href="#image026b">84</a> are “engine

<p>Figs. <a href="#image026c">91, 92, 93</a>, and <a href="#image027b">95</a> are more bottle shaped—in fact, approaching
somewhat to the form of the mediæval bellarmine. Many varieties of this
general form have been found in the marshes and elsewhere. Fig. <a href="#image026c">89</a> is
particularly simple and elegant in shape, as are also several shown in
the groups on this and the preceding pages. Among these is an example
of another variety of ornamentation common to the Upchurch ware. It is
formed by diagonal intersecting lines, and in form is much the same as
the ordinary kind of Roman cinerary urns. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span> the group, Fig. <a href="#image027a">94</a>, are
some examples of Upchurch and other wares.</p>

<p>No kilns have as yet been discovered in the Upchurch marshes, but
doubtless further researches will yet bring them to light. Mr. Roach
Smith, to whose incessant labours we owe the principal notices of these
potteries, has discovered the remains of the extensive village of the
potters, with traces of their habitations and of their graves, in the
higher ground bordering on the marshes.</p>

<p><i>Castor Ware</i>, or <i>Durobrivian Ware</i>, as it is variously
called, is the production of the extensive Romano-British potteries on
the river Nen, in Northamptonshire and Huntingdonshire; near Castor and
Chesterton, in those counties respectively. In this locality, as the
names of Chesterton and Castor undeniably prove to have been the case,
an important settlement of the Romans was made, and excavations have
brought to light the remains of a considerable town, and in connection
with it, of a settlement of potters with the remains of their works
extending over a district many miles in extent.</p>

<p>The great interest attaching to this locality is in the fact that this
was not the first, but the first well ascertained discovery of a Roman
pot-manufactory in this kingdom, and that at this spot the first kilns
of that period have been uncovered, and the processes adopted by the
Roman <i>figuli</i> brought to light.</p>

  </div>

<p>The situation of the potteries was well chosen for carrying on an
extensive trade with distant parts of the kingdom, and from researches
searches which were made, the late Mr. Artis, to whom the discovery is
due, computed that probably two thousand people had been employed in
the fabrication of fictile vessels. It is on the line of one of the
most important of the Roman roads—the Ermyn street—and close to the
navigable river Nen; and that the products of the manufactory were
supplied to places throughout the kingdom is abundantly testified by
the remains which are almost invariably found in course of excavations
wherever Roman occupation is known. Mr. Artis unfortunately, although
he published a fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span> folio volume of plates<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of the more remarkable
of the objects he discovered, never issued the descriptive and
historical text which was intended to accompany it. The great bulk
of the information he had gleaned he never committed to paper, and
consequently it died with him. Mr. Artis, however, communicated some
valuable particulars to Mr. C. Roach Smith, and these have been
made public by him in the “Journal of the British Archæological
Association”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and in the “Collectanea Antiqua.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Mr. Artis in one
of these says that during an examination of the pigments used by the
Roman potters of Castor and its neighbourhood, he was “led to the
conclusion that the blue and slate-coloured vessels met with here in
such abundance were coloured by suffocating the fire of the kiln at
the time when its contents had acquired a degree of heat sufficient to
insure uniformity of colour. I had so firmly made up my mind on the
process of manufacturing and firing this peculiar kind of earthenware,
that I had denominated the kilns in which it had been fired “smother
kilns.” The mode of manufacturing the bricks of which these kilns are
made is worthy of notice. The clay was previously mixed with about
one-third of rye in the chaff, which being consumed by the fire, left
cavities in the room of the grains. This might have been intended to
modify expansion and contraction, as well as to assist in the gradual
distribution of the colouring vapour. The mouth of the furnace and
the top of the kiln were no doubt stopped: thus we find every part of
the kiln, from the inside wall to the mouth on the outside, and every
part of the clay wrappers of the domes penetrated with the colouring
exhalation.”</p>

  </div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span></p>

<p>The researches further proved that the colour could not be attributed
to any metallic oxide (although it must be confessed that in many
instances the surface has a strongly developed metallic appearance)
either in the clay itself or applied externally, and this conclusion
is confirmed by the appearance of the clay wrappers of the dome of
the kilns; and it may be added, the colour is so fugitive that it is
expelled entirely, by submitting the pottery to an open fire. During
the examination of the Upchurch pottery, Mr. Artis remarked that he
thought a coarse kind of sedge had been used in the manufactory. His
practical eye alone guided him to this conclusion, for he had never
visited the site, and was quite unaware that below the strata of broken
vessels, a layer of sedge peat is in several places visible. The same
kind of arrangement probably obtained pretty generally with the Roman
potters.</p>

<p>The kilns for firing the Castor ware, discovered by Mr. Artis, are
among the most interesting of all the remains of Roman arts which have
been brought to light. The kilns which were removed in the course
of the investigations were “all constituted on the same principle:
a circular hole was dug from three to four feet deep, and four in
diameter, and walled round to the height of two feet. A furnace,
one-third of the kiln in length, communicated with the side. In the
centre of the circle so formed was an oval pedestal, the height of the
sides, with the end pointing to the mouth of the furnace. Upon this
pedestal and side walls the floor of the kiln rests. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> formed
of perforated angular bricks, meeting at one point in the centre; the
furnace was arched with bricks, moulded for the purpose; the side of
the kiln was constructed with curved bricks set edgeways (see Fig. <a href="#image030">100</a>)
in a thick slip (the same material made into a thin mortar) to the
height of two feet. The process of packing the vessels and securing
uniform heat in firing the ware was the same in the two different
kinds of kilns—namely, that before described, called ‘smother
kiln,’ and that for various other kinds of pottery. They were first
carefully loose-packed with the articles to be fired, up to the height
of the side walls. The circumference of the bulk was then gradually
diminished, and finished in the shape of a dome. As this arrangement
progressed, an attendant seems to have followed the packer, and thinly
covered a layer of pots with coarse hay or grass. He then took some
thin clay, the size of his hand, and laid it flat over the grass upon
the vessels: he then placed more grass on the edge of the clay just
laid on—then more clay—and so on until he had completed the circle.
By this time the packer would have raised another tier of pots, the
plasterer following as before, hanging the grass over the top edge of
the last layer of plasters, until he had reached the top, in which a
small aperture was left, and the clay nipped round the edge; another
coating would then be laid on as before described. Directly after,
gravel or loam was thrown up against the side wall where the clay
wrappers were commenced—probably to secure the bricks and the clay
coating. The kiln was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span> then fired with wood.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In consequence of the
care taken to place grass between the edges of the wrappers, they could
be unpacked in the same size pieces as when laid on in a plastic state;
and thus the danger in breaking the coat to obtain the contents of the
kiln could be obviated. In the course of my excavations I discovered a
curiously constructed furnace, of which I have never before or since
met an example. Over it had been placed two circular vessels; the next
above the furnace was a third less than the other, which would hold
about eight gallons; the fire passed partly under both of them, the
smoke escaping by a smoothly-plastered flue, from seven to eight inches
wide. The vessels were suspended by the rims fitting into a circular
groove or rabbet, formed for the purpose. They contained pottery, both
perfect and fragmentary. It is probable they had covers, and I am
inclined to think were used for glazing peculiar kinds of the immense
quantities of ornamented ware made in this district. Its contiguity
to one of the workshops in which the glaze (oxide of iron) and other
pigments were found confirms this opinion.”</p>

     <p class="p0 center sm">Fig. 102.—Potter’s Kiln, Castor.</p>
  </div>

<p>Fig. <a href="#image032">102</a> is a kiln of a different construction. “In it, instead of
modelling or moulding bricks for the kiln, the potters, after forming
a tolerably round shaft, commenced plastering it three inches thick
with clay, prepared for that purpose, leaving a flange twenty inches
above the furnace floor to receive the floor of the kiln; a mode of
construction unnoticed by me before in these kilns. In the centre
was placed an oval pedestal, for the double purpose of dividing the
fire and of giving support to the centre of the floor. To attach the
pedestal to the back of the kiln, and to shut out the cold air which
would lodge in the angle formed by the pedestal being so placed, the
angle was filled with coarse materials, which were stopped up with
clay, so as to draw the flame more towards the centre, and induce a
union with the flame and heat entering the front part of the kiln.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
The more usual plan with the potters of this district in packing their
kilns was, when the contents had reached the surface of the earth, to
form a dome by covering the urns and vases lightly with dry grass,
sedge, or the like, and plastering it over with patches of prepared
clay, divided by strewing a small quantity of hay between each portion
to facilitate removal. In place of this usual process, in this kiln
bricks were used of an oblong shape, four inches by two and a half
inches, wedge-shaped at one end, with a sufficient curve to traverse
the circumference when set edgeways, with the wedge ends lapped over
each other. The sides would be thus raised for three or four courses
or more, as circumstances might require, and probably be afterwards
backed up with loose earth. These bricks were modelled and kneaded with
chaff and grain.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The numbers indicate as follows:—1, front of
the pedestal supporting the floor of the kiln; 2 2, slopes, probably
intended to produce a more uniform heat; 3 3, part of the kiln floor;
4, bricks, before used; 5, area of the furnace; 6, mouth of furnace; 7,
wall of kiln; 8, top of the pedestal. The mouth of the furnace, No. 6,
was arched over.</p>

<p>The ware of the Durobrivian potteries was superior both in style of
art and in form and material to that of Upchurch, and has an especial
interest over it in the fact that it bears figures and various
ornaments in relief, in the same manner as on the Samian ware. The
ornament, especially the scrolls, &amp;c., were laid on “in slip.” The
vessel, after having been thrown on the wheel, would be allowed to
become somewhat firm, but only sufficiently so for the purpose of the
lathe. In the indented ware, the indenting would have to be performed
with the vessel in as pliable a state as it could be taken from the
lathe. A thick slip of the same body would then be procured, and the
ornamentation would proceed.</p>

<p>“The vessels—on which are displayed a variety of hunting subjects,
representations of fishes, scrolls, and human figures—were all glazed
after the figures were laid on; where, however, the decorations are
white, the vessels were glazed before the ornaments were added.
Ornamenting with figures of animals was effected by means of sharp and
blunt skewer instruments and a slip of suitable consistency. These
instruments seem to have been of two kinds—one thick enough to carry
sufficient slip for the nose, neck, body, and front thigh; the other
of a more delicate kind, for a thinner slip, for the tongue, lower
jaws, eye, fore and hind legs, and tail. There seems to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span> been no
retouching, after the slip trailed from the instrument. Field sports
seem to have been favourite subjects with our Romano-British artists.
The representations of deer and hare hunts are good and spirited;
the courage and energy of the hounds, and the distress of the hunted
animals are given with great skill and fidelity, especially when the
simple and off-handed process by which they must have been executed is
taken into consideration.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Another and equally pleasing variety of ornamentation, and one
peculiar, it may be said, to the Durobrivian potteries, is that whereon
the pattern consists of scrolls and flowers in white slip on the dark
bluish black ground. The effect of these simple patterns, which are
generally graceful and always elegantly formed, is remarkably pleasing.
Examples of these are given on Figs. <a href="#image035c">114 to 124</a>, which will serve to

<p>One of the most curious and interesting urns of this ware (Fig. <a href="#image038a">129</a>)
was dug up in Leicester in 1869, and is preserved in the museum of that
town. It is of a fine rich deep colour, with the pattern in white slip,
and has borne an inscription, also in slip, the only letters of which
now remaining are <span class="smcap">M E i I VI</span>. In the same museum, among other
varieties of Romano-British ware, are the beautiful vessels shown on
Figs. <a href="#image038d">132</a>, <a href="#image038e">133</a>, <a href="#image038f">134</a>. There are also fragments of ware which seem to
point at pottery which I believe, at one period of Roman occupation,
existed in the neighbourhood of Leicester.</p>

  </div>

<p>Potters’ kilns of the Romano-British period have been found in other
places, but those at Castor are the most perfect, and in every way the
best. Indeed, the others may be said, more appropriately perhaps, to
be indications of kilns rather than the kilns themselves. A curious
record of the discovery of a kiln in London, at the north-west of St.
Paul’s Cathedral, in 1677, by John Conyers, a collector of antiquities,
is preserved in the British Museum,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and has been published by Mr.
Roach Smith,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> the eminent archæologist, to whom the antiquarian
world is indebted for so much valuable information concerning Roman
antiquities. This very curious and valuable record is as follows, in
the handwriting of Conyers, and the accompanying engraving is carefully
reduced (see Fig. <a href="#image039">138</a>) from Conyers’ own drawing:—</p>

<p>“This kill was full of the coarser<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> sorts of potts or cullings,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
so that few were saved whole, viz., lamps, bottles, urnes, dishes.</p>

<p>“The forme of a kill in which the olde Romans’ lamps, urnes, and other
earthen pottes and vessels was burnt, and some left in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span> kill; and
that within a unstired, loamy ground about 26 foot deep near about the
place where the Market House stood in Oliver’s tyme, the discovery
made anno 1677 at the digging the foundacion of the north east part
of St. Paull’s, London, among gravel pitts and loam pitts, where the
ground had been at tymes raised over it 3 or 4 tymes, and so many 8
foote storyes or depths of coffins lay over the loamy kill, the lowest
coffins made of chalk; and this supposed to be before or about Domitian
the emperor’s tyme.</p>

<p>“Of these (kilns) 4 severall had been made in the sandy loam on the
ground in the fashion of a cross foundacion and only this height
standing, viz. 5 foot from topp to bottom and better; and as many feet
in breadth; and had no other matter for its form and building but the
outward loame as it naturally lays, crusted hardish by the heat burning
the loame redd like brick. The floor in the middle supported by and cut
out of loame, and helped with old-fashioned Roman tyles shards, but
very few, and such as I have seen used for repositorys for urns in the
fashion of like ovens, and they plastered within with a reddish mortar
or tarris; but here was no mortar, but only the sandy loam for cement:</p>

<p class="p-min r8">“observed and thus described</p>

<p class="p-min r4">“by <span class="smcap">Jo<sup>n</sup> Conyers</span>, Apothecary.”</p>

<p>In accordance with the above description, the sketch by Conyers shows
also the four kilns placed crosswise, leaving ample space in the centre
for the workmen. The vessels found in the kiln are thus described by
Conyers, who also made sketches of them, which are preserved along with
his MS., and have been engraved in the “Collectanea Antiqua:”—</p>

<p>“1. 1 quart earthen dish.—2. 2 gallons, whitish.—3. 4 quart
bason, whitish.—4. 8 ounce censer or lamp, whitish earth.—5. 2
quart colinder, whitish.—6. 2 pint lipp waterpott.—7. Lamp, or
censer, reddish.—8. 3 pint urne.—9. 3 quarts urne, whitish.—10. 2
ounce lamp, gilded with electrum.—11. 2 quart, white.—12. 1 pint
bottle.—13. 2 pint black urne.—14. 1 pint urne, black.—15. 6 ounce
urne.—16. 3 quart urne, blewish.—17. Half pint urne, electrum
Britan.—18. 1 pint dish, blewish.—19. 1 ounce urne, whitish.—20. 3
ounce urne, cinamon collour.—All these a sort of earth almost like
crucibles, except the black, will endure the fire like brass, as in
this day in use about Poland.”</p>

<p>From the drawings which accompany these descriptions, the
Romano-British origin of the examples found actually in the kiln<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
is placed beyond doubt. Most of them are precisely the same types
as hundreds of fragments which have been found all over London, and
are the common table and culinary ware of the period. Some bear a
very striking resemblance to the vessels from the Upchurch pottery.
Amongst them is a mortarium. Most of the vessels are plain, but some
are ornamented with rows of dots, &amp;c., and others with a reticulated
pattern. The forms are elegant and simple.</p>

<p>In another part of his MS. Conyers describes other kinds of pottery
found during the excavations. “Now these pottsherds,” he writes, “are
some glass and some potts like broken urns, which were curiously
laid on the outside with like thorne pricks of rose trees and in the
manner of raised work: this upon potts of murry collour, and here and
there grey houndes and stags and hares all in raised work: other of
these cinamon collour urne fashion and were as gilded with gold but
vaded: some of strange fashioned juggs the sides bent in so as to be
six squares, and these raised work upon them and curiously pinched as
curious raisers of paist may imitate: some like black earth for pudding
panns; one the outside indented and crossed quincunx fashion. Now many
of these potts of the finer kind are lite and thinn and these workes
raised or indented were instead of collours; yet I find they had some
odd collours, not blew, in those tymes, and a way of glazing different
to what now; and here takes notice that the redd earth before mencioned
bore away the belle.”</p>

<p>The manuscript contains also the following note:—</p>

<p>“The labourers toulde me of some remains of other such kinds of small
kills that was found up and down nere the place of the other pott
kills, and these had a funnel to convey smoke which might serve for
glass furnaces, for though not anny potts with glass in it whole in the
furnaces was there found, yet broken crucibles or tests for melting of
glass, together with boltered glass such as is to be seen remaining
at glass houses amongst the broken glass, which was glass spoyled in
the making, was there found; but not plenty, and especially coloured
and prepared for jewel-like ornament, but mostly such as for cruetts
or glasses with a lipp to drop withall, and that a greenish light blew
collour; and of any sort of glass there was but little.”</p>

<p>Remains of potteries of this period have also been discovered in
Norfolk (between Brixton and Brampton); at Botham in Lincolnshire; in
Somersetshire; at Worcester; at Marlborough; at Sibson; at various
places in Yorkshire; in Shropshire; in Oxfordshire;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span> in the New Forest,
Hampshire; at Colchester, in Essex; at Wilderspool, near Warrington;
and in many other parts of the kingdom. Of some of these I shall now
proceed briefly to speak.</p>

<p>To the Shropshire potteries—those of the clays of the Severn Valley,
probably at Brosely,—a vast number of varieties of vessels are to be
traced; and it is, as I shall show in a later chapter, interesting
to know that the same bed of clay which at the present day produces
articles of daily use, produced fifteen hundred years ago the vessels
for the table, &amp;c., of the inhabitants of the then great neighbouring
city of Uriconium. In the excavations which have been undertaken on the
site of this ruined city immense quantities of fragments of pottery
have been found, and, with the exception of the Samian ware and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
Durobrivian ware, it is not too much, perhaps, to say that the whole,
or nearly so, has been made in the Severn Valley. Of these wares, two
sorts especially are found in considerable abundance; the one white,
the other of a rather light red colour. The white, which is made of
what is commonly called Brosely clay, and is rather coarse in texture,
consists chiefly of rather handsomely shaped jugs or bellarmine-shaped
vessels, of different sizes, the general shape of which somewhat
resembles Fig. <a href="#image028">96</a>; of Mortaria; and of bowls of different shapes and
sizes, which are often <i>painted</i> with stripes of red and yellow.
The other variety, the red Romano-Salopian ware, is also made from
one of the clays of the Severn Valley, but is of finer texture, and
consists principally of jugs not dissimilar to those in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span> white
ware, except in a very different form of mouth; and of bowl-shaped
colanders.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Two examples of Romano-Salopian ware—the first of the white, and the
second of the red variety—are given on Fig. <a href="#image042a">139</a>, and on Fig. <a href="#image042b">140</a> is
represented a group of vessels of this make, from the cemetery at
Uriconium.</p>

<p>The potteries of the New Forest in Hampshire, for a lucid account
of which we are indebted to Mr. Wise,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> were of great extent,
and, as is proved by the researches which have been made on their
sites, of considerable importance. The potteries were noticed in
1853 by the Rev. J. P. Bartlett,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> who prepared an account of his
researches for the Society of Antiquaries, and since that period
both that gentleman and Mr. Wise have with great success continued
their explorations. The names of the localities where these ancient
potteries exist—<i>Crockle</i> (crock kiln or crock hill) and
<i>Panshard</i>—are highly suggestive. During the excavations kilns
were found in a perfect state. The kiln at Crockle was circular, and
measured six yards in circumference, its shape being well defined by
small hand-formed masses of red brick-earth. The floor, about two
feet below the natural surface of the ground, was paved with a layer
of sand-stones, some of them cut into a circular shape so as to fit
the kiln, the upper surfaces being tooled, whilst the under remained
in their original state. At the potteries at Audenwood no kilns were
discovered; but at Sloden, where the works cover several acres, “two
large mounds marking the sites of kilns” are remaining, along with
the sites of potters’ huts, &amp;c. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span> Island Thorn more kilns and
innumerable fragments of vessels of various kinds were discovered. In
<i>Pitts Enclosure</i>, besides mounds opened by Mr. Bartlett, Mr.
Wise discovered in one mound five kilns, ranged in a semicircle, and
paved with irregular masses of sand-stone. They were close together,
separated only by mounds of the natural soil. Besides fragments of
various vessels, “two distinct heaps of white and fawn-coloured clay
and red earth, placed ready for mixing, and a third of the two worked
together, fit for the immediate use of the potter,” were found with
these kilns.</p>

<p>Some of the more usual and more striking forms of the vessels from New
Forest potteries are grouped together on Figs. <a href="#image043a">141 to 151</a>. A selection
of patterns from the wares are grouped on Figs. <a href="#image043b">152 to 157</a>, some of
which will be seen to bear a close resemblance to those of the Castor
ware.</p>

<p>Of the potters’ kiln, &amp;c., found near Colchester, where probably some
ware in imitation of the fine red Samian was produced, a notice will
be found in “Collectanea Antiqua.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> In the Yorkshire potteries—for
there can be little doubt that at Potters Newton, at York, and at other
places pot-works existed in these early times—the curious vessels
ornamented with what are usually called “frill patterns” were made, as
also other slip and scaled patterns, as on Figs. <a href="#image044a">158</a>, <a href="#image044b">159</a>, and <a href="#image044c">160</a>.</p>

<p>At Headington, Oxfordshire, I had the good fortune myself to discover
in 1849, along with the remains of a villa and other buildings,
traces of a kiln and of many other interesting features,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span> of which I
published an account in the <i>Journal of the British Archæological
Association</i>.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The fragments of pottery found on this site were
extremely varied, and attended with some very unusual facts. One of
the most curious and interesting matters was the discovery of a clay
mould bearing a beautifully formed female head (a bacchante), with a
wreath of vine leaves encircling her brow, for the forming of heads on
Romano-British pottery. Fig. <a href="#image046">166</a> shows this mould, and Fig. <a href="#image046">167</a> gives
the impression taken from it.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> has a remarkably pleasing
expression, and is beautifully formed. The mould is a rough lump of red
clay, and has been broken on its sides.</p>

<p>The pottery, with but one or two exceptions, was in fragments; from
these the engravings here given have been carefully restored. One very
remarkable feature was the immense assemblage—a cartload at least—of
fragments of mortaria. In form and material they differed considerably
from those found in other localities. Some were of a fine buff-coloured
clay, others of a lead colour, as produced by the smother kiln, and
all well studded with broken quartz. In size they varied from seven
and a half inches to nearly two feet in diameter. The larger one on
Fig. <a href="#image047a">168</a> was one foot nine inches in diameter, while the smaller one
is only seven and a half inches. The sections of the rims of the
Headington mortaria are dissimilar to others, as I have carefully
pointed out in the communication referred to. Fig. <a href="#image047b">171</a> exhibits a
vessel of fine red ware, the rim of which is painted black, on which
the white scroll-pattern is laid. The sections of rims which accompany
it for comparison sake are, besides its own rim,—1, red with white
pattern; 2, a fine red ware; 3, a fine ware, with a metallic surface;
and 4 and 5, imported Samian. Fig. <a href="#image047c">175</a> is of chocolate colour, and is
ornamented with an indented pattern of lines of squares, alternating
with flat circles. Fig. <a href="#image047c">172</a> is of blue-gray colour, of fine and close
and very hard texture; the sides are indented. Fig. <a href="#image047c">173</a> is of light
buff colour. The curious assemblage of vessels grouped on Fig. <a href="#image048a">176</a>
are formed of a fine black clay mixed with sand. They are beautifully
formed, and many of them are ornamented with surface lines traced on
the clay without incision or indentation. The two examples (Figs. <a href="#image048f">181</a>
and <a href="#image048g">182</a>) are of tolerably fine red ware; the taller one (which has had
a handle) has been surface-coated with a red pigment. Fig. <a href="#image048c">178</a> is of
coarse red ware, and, as will be seen, is much the same in form as our
modern soup-plates. Fragments of vessels of the form of Fig. <a href="#image048e">180</a> were
very numerous. They were of coarse buff-coloured ware. Other examples
found during the excavations which I carried on are shown grouped on
Fig. <a href="#image048h">183</a>. Fig. <a href="#image048d">179</a>, like the rest, restored from fragments, is a small
and delicately formed cup, three and a quarter inches in diameter, of
rough-cast ware<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>; of these, examples were found, some of red, and
others of a chocolate colour.</p>

<p>Some good fragments of Castor ware were discovered, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span> which the
group (Figs. <a href="#image029">97 to 99</a>) has been restored. Fig. <a href="#image047c">174</a> is a small cup of
buff-coloured ware. Some small fragments of a green glazed ware were
also found.</p>

<p>Among the most curious of the discoveries were fragments of vessels of
fine clay, of a buff colour, with the patterns <i>painted</i> in red on
their surface. One of these bears the rude representation of a cock;
others have waved and scrolled patterns; and others again, lines, dots,
circles, &amp;c. Many other varieties of wares were also found, as were
some few fragments of Samian.</p>

<p>An interesting discovery of the remains of what appears to have been a
potter’s workshop was made in Dorsetshire, in 1841, by Mr. Warne, of
which he gives some very interesting particulars.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The foundations
were rectangular and clearly defined—in length forty-four feet, in
breadth twenty-five feet—constructed of flints, which are plentiful in
the neighbourhood. “In clearing out there was found a great quantity
of fragments of the ordinary smooth black and firm-grained ware: the
bottoms of some vessels were perforated like colanders. In the course
of the excavations, remains of instruments used by the potter were also
found; the most interesting being a considerable portion of a wheel,
formed of that peculiar bituminous shale well known as ‘Kimmeridge
coal.’ It is part of a circle, originally a wheel or plate, fifteen
inches in diameter and one inch and a quarter thick. It has undergone
the process of a careful and well-finished turning in the lathe. It may
at once be seen that it formed part of a potter’s wheel, the rotatory
table on which the workmen moulded, or rather when brought to the
desired form, the ductile clay received the finishing touches. There
are to be seen two or three counter-sinkings, in which were fixed the
arms of the metal axis on which it revolved. Portions of other wheels
in limestone were found, and one of great thickness, in conglomerate,
the use of which would seem to have been for pulverising the crude
material. Numerous pieces were scattered about of small and very thin
stone, of a rude but markedly angular form, similar to such as are
still, or lately were, used in the manufacture of coarse earthenware.
Amidst the <i>débris</i> was a knife fixed in a rude bone haft; with
the remains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span> were a large brass coin of Marcus Aurelius, and three
denarii of Severus Alexander, Gordianus III., and Philippus.”</p>

  </div>

<p>At Wilderspool, the presumed site of <i>Condate</i>, an outskirt of
Warrington, evidence exists which warrants the supposition that pottery
of various kinds was there made by the Romans. A large quantity of
fragments, including many interesting examples, have been collected
by Dr. Kendrick and placed in the museum at Warrington; these include
many well-known varieties of Roman wares, and some which are peculiar
to the place; among these are excellent examples of “engine-turned”
bowls, in which the engine-turning is surmounted by scoriated ornament;
these are in red clay. Of Durobrivian ware were found portions of a
bowl with overhanging rim, ornamented with the ivy-leaf pattern in
slip; on one portion is a potter’s mark, <span class="allsmcap">PAT</span>, which has been
impressed on the side. Of imitation, or English, Samian, are several
fragments, with relief ornaments, some of which are pretty close
copies of the true Samian, while others are rather clumsy adaptations
of the Samian borders, &amp;c. Examples of Upchurch ware were also found.
The wares which seem to be peculiar to Wilderspool, and which were,
there is every reason to believe, made there, are the two varieties
engraved on Figs. <a href="#image050">184</a> and <a href="#image050">185</a>, and the “rough-cast” ware, of which a
small vessel found by myself at Headington, and engraved on Fig. <a href="#image048d">179</a>,
will serve as an example. Fig. <a href="#image050">184</a> is of a light red clay, which has
been surface-coloured. It is ornamented with a mammal ornament—a
series of raised circles, about three-quarters of an inch in diameter,
dying off in their lower half, and having a knob or nipple in the
centre. This has evidently been the ornament of the upper part of a
vessel, the lower being engine-turned in diagonal lines. Fig. <a href="#image050">185</a>
is of a dark-coloured clay, with a similar kind of ornament, but of
much smaller size, the discs being only rather more than a quarter
of an inch in diameter. The “rough-cast” ware, as this variety (Fig.
<a href="#image048d">179</a>) has been appropriately named by Dr. Kendrick, is a fine kind of
red-ware, the vessels in which, after having been “thrown,” have, while
in their soft, moist state, been powdered all over with small bits of
dry clay, and then dipped in thin slip before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span> firing—the roughness
having previously been carefully removed from the rims and other parts
which were intended to be left plain. Dr. Kendrick claims this to be
hitherto “unnoticed, and therefore undescribed;” but here he is in
error, for in 1850<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> I described a similar ware—the only fragment
then known—which I discovered at Headington (Fig. <a href="#image048d">179</a>), that example
being, perhaps, a little finer and of better quality than the present
Wilderspool specimens.</p>

  </div>

<p>Another variety of ornament, supposed by Dr. Kendrick to be unique, is
on a hard bluish-grey ware; it is a series of patches of fine lines
scratched into the surface, as though done by a fine comb or a hard
brush.</p>

<p>Among the most special objects found at Wilderspool are two tetinæ, a
tragic mask, and a triplet vase. Of the mask, engraved on Fig. <a href="#image051">186</a>, Dr.
Kendrick says:—“Although it is sadly mutilated, an earthenware mask
or visor for the human face is certainly the most rare and curious of
the Roman antiquities discovered at Wilderspool. As such it has been
described and figured in the seventeenth volume<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span> of the <i>Journal of
the Archæological Association</i>. In the British Museum is a single
specimen of the comic mask, such as we often see represented on Greek
and Roman sculptures or intaglio seals; there is also another mask,
with the mouth closed, for the silent actor. The Wilderspool mask
appears to be an equally solitary example of the tragic mask, although
Pollux, an ancient writer, enumerates twenty-five typical or standing
masks of tragedy—six for old men, seven for young men, nine for
females, and three for slaves.”</p>

<p>The tetinæ, or feeding-bottles, are engraved on Figs. <a href="#image052a">187 and 188</a>;
they have tubular spouts at the side, and, when used, they were no
doubt furnished with soft nipples or teats for the tender mouth of
the infant. When found the mouth of each was covered by a fragment of
pottery, and, from their upright position and contents, there can be no
doubt that they contained the ashes of one or more children. It is also
curious to remark that one handle was suited for the right hand of the
nurse, and the other for the left, as if to compel a change of posture
for the infant.</p>

<p>The triple, or triune vase, restored on Fig. <a href="#image052b">189</a>, is an excellent
specimen, the connecting bands being hollow tubes, so that when the
liquor was placed in one, it rose to the same height in each. Many
other objects of great interest were found at Wilderspool, and have
been carefully described by Dr. Kendrick and illustrated by his
daughter.</p>

<p>At Ashdon, in Essex, a potter’s kiln was discovered by the Hon. R.
C. Neville in 1852. It was of square form, being, as nearly as could
be measured, eighteen feet square, inclusive of the outer walls. The
furnace appeared to have been at the south-west end, immediately
communicating with the central and largest flue; in it was a
considerable quantity of charcoal and black ashes. This flue was two
feet six inches across at the entrance and two feet in width along the
entire length, which divided the structure into two equal portions.
From it eight lateral flues (each seven inches wide) diverged opposite
each other on either side. It was closed by the north-eastern wall,
which was carefully constructed of Roman tiles, which, as well as the
flanged tiles in other parts, had evidently been used in some former
building. Many fragments of tiles and pottery were strewed about, but
no perfect vessel was found.</p>

<p>A kiln was discovered in 1868 at Winterton, near Brigg, on a site about
half a mile from the Roman road, and not far from where a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span> tesselated
pavement had been previously discovered. By the falling of a portion of
the side of a pit where sand was being dug, there was exposed a rudely
constructed kiln or oven, made by sinking a circular cavity about
six feet deep and six feet in diameter at the top, becoming narrower
towards the bottom, so as to be in fact an inverted cone. The lower
half of it is in the sand, and the upper half in the surface soil, and
in a thin bed of clay between this and the sand. A little more than a
foot in depth of the bottom of the pit had been filled with soil from
the surface, quite compact, as if it had been mixed with water and
well rammed down. On the top of this rested the oven itself, formed
by lining the pit with a mixture of coarse mud or clay with small
stones and pebbles, to a thickness of about four inches at the bottom,
increasing upward to ten inches at the brim,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span> which is about one foot
and a half below the present surface of the field. From the centre of
the floor thus made rises a pillar of one foot nine inches in height,
and widening from one foot diameter at the bottom to one foot ten
inches at the top, which pillar widens suddenly so as to form a sort
of mushroom head, continuous in structure with the clay or mud floor
and walls just described. Two shallow grooves run all round the inside
of the oven, a little above the top of the pillar, and broken pieces
of blue Roman pottery are laid across from the pillar to the side of
the basin so as to cover in a sort of circular flue. Over these has
been spread a thin coat of clay similar to the rest of the lining, so
that the upper storey, so to speak, is a shallow pit, about three and
a half feet diameter and one foot and a half deep. A large quantity of
black ashes, and of fragments of Roman pottery, was found in and around
the kiln. An account of this discovery, with an engraving of the kiln
appeared in vol. ix. of “The Reliquary.” Another, in the same county,
was discovered near Ancaster; and in Somersetshire a kiln has been
uncovered.</p>

<p>Many potteries besides those whose productions have been here spoken
of might be described; but as their productions were the usual classes
of domestic or sepulchral vessels, or flue and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span> tiles, it is not
perhaps necessary to enumerate them. I will therefore proceed to speak
of some of the vessels not already particularised in this chapter.</p>

<p>Amphoræ were undoubtedly made in the Roman pot-works of Britain;
evidences of their manufacture having been observed in various
localities. The most extensive of these indications was at Colchester,
from which place the example (Fig. <a href="#image054e">194</a>) is taken. These vessels are
of large dimensions, strongly formed, and usually of a buff, or
reddish-yellow colour. The forms of these vessels are of two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span> distinct
kinds—the one being tall and slender, as in Fig. <a href="#image054e">194</a>, and the other
more globular, as in Figs. <a href="#image054g">196</a> and <a href="#image054h">197</a>. They were mostly pointed at the
bottom, for the purpose of fixing them, it is believed, in the earth,
or in stands made for their reception.</p>

<p>Mortaria, of which three examples have been given (Figs. <a href="#image047a">168 to 170</a>),
formed another extensive class of domestic vessels. Their use appears
to have been the pounding and beating up, for culinary purposes, of
vegetables and other articles. Some of the examples which have been
found bear unmistakable signs of long and hard use. Their inner surface
was studded, while the clay was soft, either with small fragments of
quartz or with scoriæ of iron, so as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span> to promote trituration. The
example (Fig. <a href="#image055a">198</a>) is of somewhat different character, having more
upright, and somewhat higher, sides than usual. It has been much used.</p>

<p>Another of the more usual of the domestic vessels, of Romano-British
manufacture, is the very convenient kind of basin (Fig. <a href="#image055b">199</a>), which
will be seen to be of the same general shape as Fig. <a href="#image047b">171</a>. The form of
this basin is infinitely better, more elegant, and more convenient than
those in use among us at the present day. The central flanged rim is a
very secure and handy arrangement for holding. This example, and the
mortarium (Fig. <a href="#image055a">198</a>) were found together—in fact, inverted one into
the other—in the churchyard at Chesterfield, in Derbyshire. Many other
varieties of domestic vessels were also extensively made, but to these
it is not necessary farther to refer.</p>

<p>The sepulchral urns of Romano-British manufacture are of extremely
varied form and ornamentation. Figs. <a href="#image025">78</a>, <a href="#image038g">135</a>, <a href="#image038i">137</a>,
<a href="#image042b">140</a>, <a href="#image045a">161 to 165</a>, and
<a href="#image048h">183</a>, will serve as examples of some of the varieties. The most usual
forms, however, are perhaps Figs. <a href="#image055c">200 to 205</a>. They are of various kinds
of clays, and were generally plain, or but slightly ornamented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span></p>

<p>Other good examples of sepulchral urns of various kinds, and of
different shapes, will be seen on the three groups of pottery, &amp;c.,
found at Cirencester, shown on Figs. <a href="#image056b">203</a>, <a href="#image057a">204</a>, and <a href="#image057b">205</a>.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> On the same

Ceramic Art, as well as some metallic remains.</p>

<p>Building-tiles, flue-tiles, roof-tiles, and drain-tiles were a branch
of manufacture which was carried on to a considerable extent in various
parts of the country, and, no doubt, generally in the immediate
neighbourhood of the buildings where they were used. The building-tiles
which are to be seen in the remains of the period, as in the Jewry
Wall at Leicester, engraved on Fig. <a href="#image058a">206</a>, where occasionally they form
“herring-bone” masonry, are usually from about seven to ten inches
square, and about an inch and a half in thickness. They are frequently
marked with letters, and with feet of animals which have passed over
them (Figs. <a href="#image058b">207</a> and <a href="#image058d">209</a>). The flue-tiles are of various dimensions.
They are usually of an oblong square form, hollow throughout, with a
lateral opening in one side for the heated air to pass through (see
Fig. <a href="#image059e">214</a>). Others have two channels through their entire length, and
are without side openings. They are much ornamented with incised
patterns, and occasionally are stamped with letters. Some, too, have
figures of dogs, stags, &amp;c. They were used for various purposes.
Another example is shown lying down in the centre of the group of tiles
on Fig. <a href="#image059a">210</a>. In this group, the tall example, represented standing
upright, will be sufficient to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span> show the form and excellence of
construction of the drain-tiles—the small end of each being made to
fit with an elbow joint into the thick end of the next. In the same
group are some open-flanged drain-tiles. An inscribed flange-tile is
shown on Fig. <a href="#image060b">217</a>.</p>

<p>The roofing-tiles were much more calculated to resist the wind and
rain than those of later invention. They had flanged sides, which
fitted close to each other and were covered at the joint by a small
semicircular tile, like a draining or ridge-tile, imbedded in mortar
and resting on the two roofing-tiles, as a draining-tile rests on its
sole. This arrangement is shown on Fig. <a href="#image059b">211</a>, which represents some
roofing-tiles found at Walesby. Of the ridge-tiles, of semicircular
form, to cover the joints, two good examples (Figs. <a href="#image059c">212</a> and <a href="#image059e">215</a>), from
Headington, are here given.</p>

<p>It may be added that, on tiles of one kind or other, the name of the
legions and cohorts quartered in particular localities where they were
made, are frequently found impressed. The soldiers were brick-makers
and masons, and made the tiles and built the houses, &amp;c., at the places
where they were stationed. Tile-stamps thus become important aids to
history.</p>

<p>It is curious to add that some of the tiles which have been found
tell a silent tale, which they were never intended to carry, of the
dress or hand or foot of the maker, which have become accidentally
impressed upon their surface while in a soft state, and are afterwards
rendered imperishable by firing in the kiln. One example of this kind
of accidental ornamentation (Fig. <a href="#image058b">207</a>), which exhibits the impress of
a man’s feet, or, rather, shoes thickly studded with nails,—like the
“hob-nailed” boots of our own day,—will suffice as an illustration.</p>

<p>One extraordinary and highly interesting use of tiles among the Roman
inhabitants of Britain was that of forming them into tombs.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span> A
large tile was laid flat on the ground; two others of the same length
were placed upright, one at each side, to form the sides; two shorter
ones were placed upright as ends; and another tile formed the cover
(Fig. <a href="#image060a">216</a>). Thus a fictile cist, or chest, was formed, and in this was
deposited the sepulchral urn containing the ashes of the departed,
with its accompanying group of smaller vessels. Cists of this kind are
found frequently in the Roman cemeteries at Colchester. “The practice
of enclosing or covering the sepulchral deposits with tiles appears to
have been so general, that the word <i>tegula</i>, a tile, was often
used to signify a tomb. The reader will at once call to mind the lines
of Ovid:—</p>

<p>It appears from these lines that it was the custom for the relatives
to place garlands, fruit, and salt on the tile which covered the
sepulchral deposit.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>At York, graves, or rather tombs, formed of a number of roof-tiles,
have been found. Fig. <a href="#image061a">218</a> represents one of these curious tombs. It was
formed of ten roof-tiles, four of which were placed on either side, and
one at each end, and four ridge tiles arranged along the top. Each tile
bore the impressed stamp of the VI. Legion (Leg. VI., <i>Legio sexta
victrix</i>—the sixth legion victorious). In these tile-tombs urns had
in one instance been placed; in another (the one engraved) were the
remains of the funeral fire, with the ashes of the dead. Clay coffins
have also occasionally been found. One of these, from Aldborough, is
shown on Fig. <a href="#image061b">219</a>.</p>

<p>Lamps were undoubtedly made in various parts of this kingdom, and were
more or less ornamented; some bear excellently executed figures and
other devices. Many appear to have been made at Colchester, and are
spoken of by Mr. Roach Smith in his “Collectanea Antiqua.” The pot
works at this place appear to have been on the Lexden Road, where a
kiln and many other remains have been brought to light.</p>

<p>Penates and other figures, or statuettes, were also made in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
country; and these, again, it is pretty certain, were made in
considerable numbers at Colchester, as were also lachrymatories,
unguentaria, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Coin moulds, for the manufacture of spurious Roman coins, were also
made of clay, and the arrangement was very simple, but effective.
The clay being properly tempered and prepared, was formed into small
round tablets of uniform size and thickness. A coin was then pressed
between two tablets while the clay was soft, so as to leave a perfect
impression, and these impressions, which had thus become obverse and
reverse moulds, were arranged together in little piles; the upper and
lower being impressed on one side only. Down the sides of each of these
little piles or heaps a nick or notch was then cut, so as to admit
the molten metal. Two or three of these heaps were then, as shown in
the engraving (Fig. <a href="#image063b">221</a>), placed side by side with the notches joined
together, and these were then surrounded by a clay cone with a hole
at the top, into which the metal was poured, and ran down through the
notches, and so into the moulds. Impressions were thus taken the exact
counterpart of the original coin from which the moulds had been taken.</p>

<p class="hangingindent">Anglo-Saxon Pottery—Forms of Vessels, from Illustrated
MSS.—Culinary Vessels—Pitchers and other domestic
Vessels—Cinerary Urns—Cemeteries at Kingston, King’s Newton,
Bedford, &amp;c.—Modes of ornamenting.</p>
</div>


<p>For examples of the ceramic art of the Anglo-Saxon period we are mainly
indebted to the cemeteries and burial mounds of that people. The art
during this period, so far as this country is concerned, was but little
practised, except, as in the Celtic period, for the manufacture of
sepulchral urns of one kind or other. Still, it is pretty certain that
many of the vessels found in the barrows were made for the purposes
of life, and used for those of death when urns were wanted. In the
preceding era the population of this country—the Romano-Britons—were
essentially a pot-producing people, and they established, as will have
been seen, extensive manufactories in various parts of the kingdom,
and made and supplied vessels for every conceivable use and purpose.
When the Saxons took possession of the country, and gradually extended
themselves over its length and breadth, they found the Roman towns,
as well as the stations and detached dwellings—nay, they found every
part of the island—well and, indeed, profusely stocked with crockery
of every kind, from the finest Samian cup and bowl down to the coarsest
mortarium and amphora, in such profusion, and in such variety, as
well as of such elegance, use, and beauty, as they had not previously
known. Fighting their way here, and settling there, they utilised the
crockery which so abundantly lay ready to their hands, and, as there
can be no doubt the Roman potters continued their works long after the
advent of the Saxons, they used these Roman vessels for all purposes,
and thus did not, except in the case of their burial urns and ordinary
domestic vessels, resembling in a somewhat striking manner some modern
utensils, leave the impress of what little taste or skill they had upon
the productions of the fictile art. The cinerary urns are, therefore,
almost, the only productions of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span> Saxon potter which are known.
These, like those of the Celtic period, were, there can be no doubt,
usually made in pretty close proximity to their place of burial, and,
consequently, were formed of the clays of the district. They assumed a
peculiar character, and are entirely dissimilar to those of either of
the preceding periods.</p>

<p>Of the forms of other vessels of the Anglo-Saxons—for there is no
doubt that coarse domestic utensils were to some extent made—a
tolerable idea may be gained from the illuminated MSS. of the time.
Some few, but very few, examples have also been brought to light, which
may with tolerable certainty be assigned to this period.</p>

<p>The engravings (Figs. <a href="#image065a">222 to 227</a>) showing a few of the forms taken from
the illuminated MSS. of this and the succeeding period, are interesting
examples. Some of these will be seen to owe their origin—as, for
instance, Fig. <a href="#image065e">226</a>—to Roman design, while others are equally as
clearly Franco-Gaulish in character. The Anglo-Saxons were not, like
their Roman forerunners, an artistic race. They could not draw the form
of the human figure correctly, nor, indeed, that of animals; but their
delineations of jugs and pitchers are proved by existing examples to be
pretty accurate. Their mind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span> as a rule, was coarse and unpoetic as
their own beer, while that of the Roman was bright and sparkling as his
own champagne.</p>

<p>The scene depicted on Fig. <a href="#image065c">224</a> exhibits some well-formed vessels in the
foreground, while the dinner scene on Fig. <a href="#image065a">222</a> shows other varieties.</p>

<p>For culinary purposes the Anglo-Saxons appear to have had a kind of
aversion to clay, hence their bowls were principally of metal or
wood—generally of ash, and their drinking-vessels were of horn or
glass.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> One form of vessel, made of coarse buff-coloured clay, is
here shown (Fig. <a href="#image066b">229</a>); and another of simple form is shown on Fig. <a href="#image066c">230</a>.</p>

<p>The pottery of the Anglo-Saxon grave-mounds and cemeteries consists,
unlike that of the preceding periods, almost exclusively of cinerary
urns, and these have, as has been already stated on a previous page,
been made near the place of sepulture; and, as a natural consequence,
of the clays found in the neighbourhood. This is proved, incontestably,
in the case of the urns found at King’s Newton, where the bed of clay
still exists, and has very recently been used for common pottery
purposes.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The shape of the cinerary urns is somewhat peculiar, and partakes of
the Frankish form, which may be called degraded Roman. Instead of
being wide at the mouth, like the Celtic urns, they are more or less
contracted, and have a kind of neck instead of the overhanging lip
or rim which is so eminently characteristic of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span> pottery of that
period. Some, however, are tolerably wide at the mouth; but these are
usually low and shallow. The cinerary urns were formed by hand, not on
the wheel, although on some other vessels evidence of wheel-turning
is apparent. This is another proof that these sepulchral urns were
made on the spot where wanted. They are as a rule, perhaps, more
firmly fired than those of the Celtic period. They are usually of a
dark-coloured clay, sometimes nearly black, at other times of a dark
brown, and occasionally of a slate, or greenish tint, produced by
surface-colouring.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image070">

    src="images/image070.jpg"
     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center sm">Figs. 245 to 247.—Mayer Museum.</p>
  </div>

<p>Their general form will be best understood by reference to the
engravings, Figs. <a href="#image067a">232 to 244</a>. One of these will be seen to have
projecting knobs or bosses, which have been formed by simply pressing
out the pliant clay from the inside with the hand. In other examples
these raised bosses take the form of ribs gradually swelling out
from the bottom, till, at the top, they expand into semi-eggshaped
protuberances. The ornamentation on the urns from these cemeteries
usually consists of encircling incised lines in bands or otherwise,
and vertical or zig-zag lines arranged in a variety of ways, and, not
unfrequently, the knobs or protuberances of which I have just spoken.
Sometimes, also they present evident attempts at imitation of the Roman
egg-and-tongue ornament. The marked features of the pottery of this
period is the frequency of small punctured or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span> impressed ornaments,
which are introduced along with the lines or bands with very good
effect. These ornaments were evidently produced by the end of a stick
cut and notched across in different directions, so as to produce
crosses and other patterns. In some districts, especially in the East
Angles, these vessels are ornamented with simple patterns painted upon
their surface in white; but, so far as my knowledge goes, no example of
this kind of decoration has been found in the Mercian cemeteries.</p>

  </div>

<p>Of the East-Anglian urns, Mr. Wright—to whom and to Mr. Roach Smith
is mainly due the credit of having correctly appropriated them to the
Anglo-Saxon period—thus speaks:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The pottery is usually made of a rather dark clay, coloured
outside brown or dark slate-colour, which has sometimes a tint
of green, and is sometimes black. These urns appear often to
have been made with the hand, without the employment of the
lathe; the texture of the clay is rather coarse, and they
are rarely well baked. The favourite ornaments are bands of
parallel lines encircling the vessel, or vertical and zigzags,
sometimes arranged in small bands, and sometimes on a larger
scale, covering half the elevation of the urn; and in this
latter case the spaces are filled up with small circles and
crosses, and other marks, stamped or painted in white. Other
ornaments are met with, some of which are evidently unskilful
attempts at imitating the well-known egg-and-tongue and other
ornaments of the Roman Samian ware, which, from the specimens,
and even fragments, found in their graves, appear to have been
much admired and valued by the Anglo-Saxons. But a still more
characteristic peculiarity of the pottery of the Anglo-Saxon
burial urns consists in raised knobs or bosses, arranged
symmetrically round them, and sometimes forming a sort of ribs,
while in the ruder examples they become mere round lumps, or
even present only a slight swelling of the surface of the
vessel. That these vessels belong to the early Anglo-Saxon
period is proved beyond any doubt by the various objects, such
as arms, personal ornaments, &amp;c., which are found with them,
and they present evident imitations both of Roman forms and
of Roman ornamentation. But one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span> of these urns has been found
accompanied with remarkable circumstances, which not only show
its relative date, but illustrate a fact in the ethnological
history of this early period. Among the Faussett collection
of Anglo-Saxon antiquities is an urn which Bryan Faussett
appears to have obtained from North Elmham, in Norfolk, and
which contained the bones of a child. It is represented in the
accompanying engraving (Fig. <a href="#image070">245</a>), and will be seen at once
to be perfectly identical in character with the East-Anglian
sepulchral urns. But Mr. Roach Smith, in examining the various
objects in the Faussett collection, preparatory to his edition
of Bryan Faussett’s “Inventorum Sepulchrale,” discovered on
one side of this urn a Roman sepulchral inscription, which is
easily read as follows:—</p>

<table class="smaller">
  <tr>
    <td class="cht">D. M.</td>
    <td class="cht1">To the gods of the shades.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td class="cht">LAELIAE</td>
    <td class="cht1">To Lælia</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td class="cht">RVFINAE</td>
    <td class="cht1">Rufina.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td class="cht">VIXIT·A·XIII</td>
    <td class="cht1">She lived thirteen years,</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td class="cht">M·III·D·VI.</td>
    <td class="cht1">three months, and six days.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>To this Roman girl, with a purely Roman name, belonged, no
doubt, the few bones which were found in the Anglo-Saxon burial
urn when Bryan Faussett received it; and this circumstance
illustrates several important as well as interesting questions
relating to our early history. It proves, in the first place,
what no judicious historian now doubts, that the Roman
population remained in the island after the withdrawal of the
Roman power, and mixed with the Anglo-Saxon conquerors; that
they continued to retain, for some time at least, their old
manners and language, and even their Paganism and their burial
ceremonies; for this is the purely Roman form of sepulchral
inscriptions; and that, with their own ceremonies, they buried
in the common cemetery of the new Anglo-Saxon possessors of the
land, for this urn was found in an Anglo-Saxon burial-ground.
This last circumstance had already been suspected by
antiquaries, for traces of Roman interment in the well-known
Roman leaden coffins had been found in the Anglo-Saxon
cemetery at Ozingell, in the Isle of Thanet; and other similar
discoveries have, I believe, been made elsewhere. The fact of
this Roman inscription on an Anglo-Saxon burial urn, found
immediately in the district of the Anglo-Saxon cemeteries,
which have produced so many of these East Anglian urns,
proves further that these urns belong to a period following
immediately upon the close of what we call the Roman period.”</p>
</div>

<p>The sepulchral vases found in the district of the Middle Angles vary
but slightly in form from the East-Anglian burial urns. An example
is given in Fig. <a href="#image070">246</a>, from Chestersovers, in Warwickshire, where it
was found with an iron sword, a spear-head, and other articles of
Anglo-Saxon character.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If we had not abundant proofs of the Anglo-Saxon character of
this pottery at home,” continues Mr. Wright, “we should find
sufficient evidences of it among the remains of the kindred
tribes on the Continent, the old Germans, or Alemanni, and
the Franks. Some years ago, an early cemetery, belonging to
the Germans, or Alemanni, who then occupied the banks of the
Upper Rhine, was discovered near a hamlet called Selzen, on the
northern bank of that river, not far above Mayence, and the
rather numerous objects found in it are, I believe, preserved
in the Mayence Museum. They were communicated to the public
by the brothers Lindenschmit, in a well-illustrated volume
published in 1848, under the title ‘Das Germanische Todtenlager
bei Selzen in der Provinz Reinhessen.’ When this book appeared
in England, our antiquaries were astonished to find in the
objects discovered in the Alemannic cemeteries of the country
bordering on the Rhine a character entirely identical with
that of their own Anglo-Saxon antiquities, by which the close
affinity of the two races was strikingly illustrated. More
recently, the subject has been further illustrated in the
description by Ludwig Lindenschmit of the collection of the
national antiquities in the Ducal Museum of Hohenzollern, and
in other publications. About the same time with the first
labours of the Lindenschmits, a French antiquary, Dr. Rigollot,
was calling attention in France to similar discoveries in the
cemeteries which the Teutonic invaders of Picardy had left
behind them, and in which he recognised the same character as
that displayed by the similar remains of the Anglo-Saxons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span> in
our island. Similar discoveries have been made in Burgundy
and in Switzerland, the ancient country of the Helvetii;
and it is hardly necessary here to do more than mention the
great and valuable researches carried on by the Abbé Cochet
among the Frankish graves in Normandy. It has thus become an
established fact that the varied remains of the tribes, all
of Teutonic descent, who settled on the borders of the Roman
empire along the whole extent of the country from Great Britain
to Switzerland, present the same character and bear a close
resemblance.”</p>
</div>

     <p class="p0 center sm">Figs. 253 to 256.</p>
  </div>

<p>A few figures here given will illustrate this resemblance. Figs.
<a href="#image071">248 and 251</a> are two Allemannic urns from the cemetery of Selzen. It
will be seen that they resemble in form the East Anglian urns, and
the same ornamentation is also found among our general Anglo-Saxon
pottery. These urns are described as being usually made of the clay
of the neighbourhood, in most cases turned on a lathe, but many of
them imperfectly baked. They are found in graves where the body had
not undergone cremation, and were used for containing articles of a
miscellaneous description. Fig. <a href="#image071">252</a> is a slate-coloured urn, procured
at Cologne, and is ornamented with circular stamps. Figs. <a href="#image071">249 and
251</a> are Frankish urns, obtained by the Abbé Cochet from Londinières
in Normandy, and show at a glance the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span> identity of the Frankish
pottery with the Germanic as well as with the Anglo-Saxon. The second
of these is surrounded with a row of the well-known bosses, which
are equally characteristic of the three divisions of this Teutonic
pottery—Anglo-Saxon, Frankish, and Allemannic. Above these bosses
is an ornament identical with that of the East Anglian urn with the
sepulchral inscription. Figs. <a href="#image073">253 to 256</a> are urns from the Swiss
Lacustrine habitations, for comparison of form.</p>

<p>The series of engravings (Figs. <a href="#image067a">232 to 244</a>) will show the general and
more characteristic forms of purely Anglo-Saxon cinerary urns. Figs.
<a href="#image067a">232</a> and <a href="#image068">235</a> are of the low or flat variety, which is of not unfrequent
occurrence. Figs. <a href="#image067c">234</a> and <a href="#image068">236</a> are also of a not uncommon form, while
<a href="#image069">240</a> is more uncommon. Fig. <a href="#image069">241</a> is of excellent form, and is very
simple in ornamentation, having only encircling and diagonal lines, to
decorate its surface. Figs. <a href="#image069">243, 244, and 239</a> are of different shape,
and so again are Figs. <a href="#image069">237 and 240</a>, which are almost unique in form and
in ornamentation.</p>

<p>Most of these examples are from one locality, King’s Newton, in
Derbyshire, within a few miles of the capital of the kingdom of Mercia.
The others (Fig. <a href="#image067a">232</a>) are from Kingston, in the same neighbourhood.
Other characteristic examples of form and decoration are given on
Figs. <a href="#image067b">233</a> and <a href="#image067c">234</a>. These are from the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, and
from the Norwich Museum, and exhibit excellent specimens of forms and
decoration from those districts.</p>

<p>The ornamentation on Anglo-Saxon cinerary urns consists usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span> of
encircling lines in bands, or otherwise; in vertical or zig-zag lines,
arranged in a variety of ways; of impressed or punctured ornaments; and
of knobs or protuberances. Sometimes also, as in a Bedfordshire urn,
they present evident attempts at imitation of the Roman egg-and-tongue
ornament. In some districts small ornaments are painted on the surface
with a white pigment. The marked feature of the pottery of this period
is the frequency of the small punctured or impressed ornaments to which
I have alluded, which are introduced along with the lines or bands,
with very good effect. These ornaments were evidently usually produced
by the end of a stick, cut and notched across in different directions,
so as to produce crosses and other patterns. In other instances these
impressed ornaments have been produced by twisted slips of metal, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the woodcut (Figs. <a href="#image074d">260</a> and <a href="#image074e">261</a>) I have endeavoured to show two of
the notched-stick “punches,” such as I have reason to believe were
used for pressing into the soft clay, and also the impressed patterns
produced by them.</p>

<p>The quatrefoils (or as they may almost be called, crosses patée) on
some of the urns I have engraved, particularly on Figs. <a href="#image069">237, 238, and
239</a>, are very unusual, as are also those in the lower bands of Figs.
<a href="#image069">237 and 240</a>, and in the upper band of the latter example.</p>

<p>Other modes of ornamenting are shown on Fig. <a href="#image067c">234</a>.</p>

<p>Of the pottery of the Norman period but little has been said by any
writers, and that simply because but little was known. I had the good
fortune, however, a few years’ back, to discover the remains of a
kiln<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> of that period, in and around the remains of which were many
vessels—“wasters” as they would be technically called—of various
kinds. This discovery was all the more interesting and valuable,
as being the only instance of the finding of a kiln either of the
Anglo-Saxon or Norman periods, and it has enabled me to identify and
appropriate to this age vessels from other localities. To these I shall
presently refer.</p>

  </div>

<p>The pottery of this period consisted chiefly of pitchers, dishes,
bowls, or basins, and what we should now term porringers or pipkins;
the bowls or basins and dishes being used for drinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span> purposes
as well as for placing cooked meats in; the pitchers for holding
and carrying ale, mead, water, and other liquors to the table, and
the porringers both for eating and for cooking with. The uses of
these vessels, as well as their general forms, are gathered from the
illuminated MSS. of the time which have come down to us. The annexed
engraving (Fig. <a href="#image077b">264</a>) from a twelfth-century MS., shows the pitchers,
the water or wine vessels—both in their locker and being carried
up to the feast by attendants, one of whom is drawing water from a
draw-well in the yard. Fig. <a href="#image077a">263</a> shows, on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span> table set out for dinner,
the bowls or basins for the food and for drinking from, one of which
holds a fish. The plate-like articles, it should be mentioned, are
bread which was made in cakes, and variously ornamented with the knife.
The other engravings (Figs. <a href="#image076a">262</a> and <a href="#image078b">266</a>) are excellent representations
of pitchers and wine vessels, drinking-cups and bowls, and other
characteristic vessels. The next Fig. (<a href="#image078a">265</a>) gives the form of the
drinking-cups excellently well, and enables one to determine that the
small vessel engraved (Fig. <a href="#image070">246</a>) was one used for that purpose. It
should be stated, however, that, as in the former case, the objects
between the drinking-cups on the table are not plates, but cakes of
bread.</p>

<p>The clay of which Norman pottery is formed is usually of a coarse kind,
and the vessels bear evidence in many instances of the wheel having
been used. In colour they are sometimes of a reddish brown, at others
of a tolerably good red, while at others again they are nearly black;
and many of the pitchers, &amp;c., are either wholly or partially covered
with a green or other glaze. Many are quite devoid of ornament, but
others have the ends of the handles formed into foliage, &amp;c., by the
pressure of the finger. Some, however, are rather highly decorated.
Figs. <a href="#image078c">267 to 270</a> show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span> four small-sized jugs, ranging from four and a
half to seven inches in height, two of which are devoid of ornament,
and the other two have their handles foliated. Figs. <a href="#image079b">273 and 275</a> show
pitchers of a larger growth, of the same clumsy coarse kind of clay,
and ornamented in the same primitive manner. They are about nine inches
in height, and are green glazed.</p>

<p>Figs. <a href="#image079a">271 and 272</a> represent the two sides of a remarkably fine pitcher,
which (as well as those engraved on Figs. <a href="#image078c">267 to 279</a>) was discovered
by myself in a kiln to which reference has been made. It is sixteen
inches in height, and is, perhaps, the finest and most interesting
fictile remain of the Norman period in existence. It bears, as will be
seen, five horseshoes, and two buckles, all of which were badges of the
Ferrars family (Norman Earls of Derby), who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span> lords of the soil
where, and at the time when, these vessels were made. The decorations
are all laid on in “slip” of a finer kind of clay than that of which
the body is composed, and the pitcher is glazed. Herring-bone pattern
is incised in the body of the pitcher itself.</p>

<p>While speaking of this pitcher it may not be out of place to allude to
a ludicrous mistake made in Miss Meteyard’s “Life of Wedgwood.” On page
38, vol. i. of that work, Miss Meteyard has copied my own woodcut which
appeared some little time before, both in the “Reliquary” and in my
own “Life of Wedgwood;” but her artist having made his tracing from my
woodcut has <i>reversed</i> it in his copy, and thus made it worse than
useless.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#image080b">274</a> represents a “porringer” or pipkin from the same place. It is
of red clay; but others were found of a dark clay, and partly glazed. A
kind of clumsy dish and a bottle-shaped vessel with a side handle are
shown on the next engravings (Figs. <a href="#image080a">276</a> and <a href="#image080b">277</a>).</p>

<p>Fragments of a number of large pitchers, highly decorated with flowers,
bosses, &amp;c., in slip, and incised patterns, were also found. Among
the more interesting of these were some bearing round the neck rude
attempts at faces and arms. Two of these are shown on Figs. <a href="#image080c">278 and 279</a>.</p>

<p>The domestic vessels of a somewhat later date appear, in many
instances, to retain the same general form, but in others present new
shapes. Fortunately, we can again fall back upon the illuminated MSS.
for forms of these vessels, and can compare them with actual examples.</p>

<p>Thus on Fig. <a href="#image082a">284</a> we have a dish of the fourteenth, and in Fig. <a href="#image081d">283</a>
those of the fifteenth century; while in the others we have drinking
cups, bowls, three-legged vessels with spouts, &amp;c. Fig. <a href="#image081c">282</a> gives us a
wash-hand basin and jug—an attendant holding the basin in one hand and
jug in the other while the guest washes his hands, a female standing
by with the towel. In Fig. <a href="#image081b">281</a> we have a remarkably fine assemblage
of pitchers of the fourteenth century, some of which appear to be
ornamented with cross bands; while in Fig. <a href="#image081a">280</a> (the dancing of Herodias
before Herod) we have dishes, jugs, and bowls. Some of the vessels in
these illuminations, it must be borne in mind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span> may be of metal, but
the form is still of the same value and importance. Some excellent
figures of mediæval jugs are also given in the next engravings, one of
which (Fig. <a href="#image082d">287</a>) likewise shows a drinking-mug.</p>

<p>One of the earliest written notices of crockery we have is the
oft-quoted entry in the account of payments by the executors of Queen
Eleanor, wife of Edward I. “Item Juliana la potere pro ccc picheriis
die anniversarii Reginæ viij<i>s</i>. vj<i>d</i>.”—these three
hundred pitchers being probably earthenware vessels “provided for the
feast given to the poor on the anniversary of the queen’s death.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Another item in the same accounts is also curious: “Item, Johanni
le squeler pro <span class="allsmcap">M</span><sup>le</sup> et <span class="allsmcap">D</span> discis, tot platelles,
tot salseriis, et cccc chiphis, xlij<i>s</i>.”—the “squeler,” or
“sargeant-squylloure,” being “pourveyour of the squylery,” or scullery,
who had charge of the pots, and kept them clean and in order. In the
household books of Edward IV. and Sir John Howard, in the fifteenth
century, and the Earl of Northumberland, shortly afterwards, mention
is made of “earth and asshen cuppes” and “erthyn potts”—the latter
directing that leather pots<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span> be bought in place of earthen ones,
of course in consequence of the loss by breakage. The entry in the
expenses of Sir John Howard, in 1466, referred to, shows somewhat
curiously the cost of “potes” in those days:—“Watekin bocher of Stoke
delyvered of my mony to on of the poteres of Horkesley iv<sup>s.</sup> vi<sup>d.</sup>
to pay hemselfe and his felawes for xi dosen potes,” which would be
about 4¾<i>d.</i> per dozen for them.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image084a">

<p>The vessels made in England in mediæval times principally consisted
of pitchers and jugs, cups or bowls, bottles, and dishes; the term
“pottes” being applied to the drinking cups then in general use. From
them and their successors the “ale pots,” of which I shall yet speak,
the still common term of a <i>pot</i> of ale has gradually come down
to us. One shape of these drinking vessels is shown in the two smaller
vessels, Figs. <a href="#image083b">293 and 294</a>, the larger ones being excellent examples of
the jugs in use along with them. These were dug up in Oxford, in 1838,
and are preserved in the Ashmolean Museum. Other good examples of jugs,
in the Jermyn Street Museum, are shown on Figs. <a href="#image083a">290</a> and <a href="#image083c">295</a>. These are
all plain, but are glazed.</p>

<p>The larger jugs, or pitchers, are frequently ornamented with heads,
foliage, or other devices, in somewhat high relief. Many of these are
very curious. They were made in different parts of the country, of the
common clays of the locality, and decorated according to the taste and
skill of the maker.</p>

<p>Jugs, or vessels for liquor, were occasionally, from a very early
period, made in form of mounted knights. Indeed, from the occurrence
of grotesque heads and portions of figures on the Norman vessels
which I had the good fortune to exhume a few years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span> back,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> it is
probable these grotesque vessels may, in some instances, trace from
that date. A very interesting example (Fig. <a href="#image084b">297</a>) was found at Lewes in
1846. It is in the form of a mounted knight. The workmanship is very
rude, but there are certain details, such as the long pointed toes
and pryck spurs, from which its probable date is assigned to the time
of Henry II. Its length is ten and half inches, and its full height,
when perfect, would be thirteen or fourteen inches.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span> The material is
coarse clay, the upper parts green glazed. There can be no doubt it
was intended to contain liquor, and the handle, which passes from the
back of the knight to the tail of the horse, was evidently intended for
pouring out the contents; whilst a circular aperture at the lower end
of the handle afforded the means of filling the vessel.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> There is no
evidence to show where this was made.</p>

<p>Another curious example (Fig. <a href="#image085a">298</a>) preserved in the Salisbury Museum,
was found at Mere, in Wiltshire, and is believed to belong to the
latter half of the twelfth century. The costume and accoutrements of
this figure (which is a knight on horseback, armed with shield, &amp;c.)
correspond almost precisely to that of the effigy of King Richard I.
on his great seal.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The impressed circles are probably intended to
represent chain mail.</p>

<p>Another vessel, of analogous character, preserved in the Scarborough
Museum, is engraved on Fig. <a href="#image085b">299</a>. It is in the form of an animal with
a twisted horn, but its handle and other parts are imperfect. It is
covered with a green glaze, and was, there cannot be the shadow of a
doubt, made at Scarborough, where, as I shall show, the remains of a
potter’s kiln was found in 1854, but has not, as yet, been named in any
work on pottery.</p>

<p>A jug, which would almost appear to have been the origin of the
bellarmine, to be hereafter described, was communicated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span> Mr. Kirwan
to the <i>Journal of the British Archæological Association</i>,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
where it is engraved. It is covered with green glaze, and bears a
well and powerfully moulded head, with the flowing hair and beard so
characteristic of the time of Edward I., II., and III. To this period
some clay moulds for the forming of faces upon mediæval pottery, found
at Lincoln by Mr. Arthur Trollope, may be assigned; they are engraved
by Marryatt,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and will be referred to later on in this volume. It
will be seen, too, on comparison of this jug with the fragments of
Norman pottery on another page, that it is the same kind of general
idea, somewhat amplified, but carried out in the taste of the day.</p>

<p>The costrils, or pilgrims’ bottles as they are commonly called,
<i>i.e.</i>, bottles for liquor to be carried and hung on the person,
were much made in the Middle Ages, and although usually plain, were,
nevertheless, sometimes rather highly decorated. Fig. <a href="#image086a">300</a> is the
shape mostly known as a pilgrim’s bottle, and will be seen to vary
but little from the flattened globular amphora of Roman times (Fig.
<a href="#image087a">303</a>). Sometimes they had four loops instead of handles, so that the
strap could pass through the four loops and make the carrying safer.
To this class a remarkably fine example in the Roach Smith collection
in the British Museum belongs. On one side are the royal arms of
Henry VIII. within a rose and garter, and with supporters and crown,
with the legend <span class="allsmcap">DNE SALVVM FAC REGEM REGINAM ET REGNVM</span> (God
keep safe the King, Queen, and kingdom): on the other side are four
medallions: one contains the sacred monogram, I.H.S.; two others have
radiating patterns, and the fourth a heart, with loveknot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span> of flowers
and the word <span class="allsmcap">LEAL</span>. Fig. <a href="#image087a">303</a> shows another example, somewhat
of the form of Figs. <a href="#image086a">300</a> and <a href="#image086c">302</a>; but in this case it is globular,
or gourd-shaped, and not flattened on the sides, and the handles for
the loops are simply flat pieces of clay pierced for suspension. This
interesting example, which is of Tickenhall make, belongs to Sir J.
H. Crewe, Bart., and is mottled with green all over its surface.
Another excellent form of mediæval “pilgrim’s bottle” was found at
Collingbourne Ducis by the Rev. W. C. Lukis, F.S.A. It is of barrel
shape, and has handles and mouth at the top, and, at the bottom, a
stand. In front is a face surrounded by oak-leaves, within a circle of
foliage, all in relief, and above this is an aperture. Other vessels
partaking of the barrel-shape and mammiform character are also met
with: some of their forms will be seen on Figs. <a href="#image087b">304 to 307</a>. When
carried, they would be slung by the handles in the same manner as
others; but when not in use, instead of having a base, as in Fig. <a href="#image087a">303</a>,
one end is seen to be flattened for it to stand upon; the other end is
in form of a woman’s breast—this, of course, in allusion to the use
of the vessel, from the mouth of which the person who used it would
drink or “suck” the liquor it contained. A much more perfectly formed
mammiform bottle I give, from a beautiful drawing furnished me, with
others, by my friend the late Mr. F. C. Lukis, F.S.A., on Figs. <a href="#image087b">304</a> and
<a href="#image087c">305</a>. It is gourd-shaped, with one side flattened to prevent its rolling
when set down, and the other side is a beautifully formed female
breast. It is four and a half inches in height, and holds about half a
pint.</p>

<p>The cruskin, or cruse, or cruske, was much in use, and made of somewhat
varied form. It was the precursor of the tyg, and was nothing more than
a drinking-cup. References are frequently found to this vessel, as a
“crusekyn de terre,” and as having, in some instances, been mounted
with silver. Usually, however, they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span> plain cups of earthenware
or of wood, generally ash, the latter partaking somewhat of the form
of our present basin. I am inclined to think, too, that the pipkin,
or porringer, was also called a cruske or cruskin. The term is still
in use in Ireland, where a “cruisken of whiskey” is a common form of
expression. Some of the forms of the “cruisken” as at present in use in
Ireland—made of wood—are shown on Figs. <a href="#image089a">308 to 311</a>.</p>

<p>The godet, or goddard, was another drinking-cup much in vogue, and
was, evidently, a kind of large cup or bowl, in which spiced liquor
was mixed and drunk by “gossips” and friends. Some of these bowls
will be spoken of later on. Besides these, various other names for
drinking-vessels were more or less in use.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the potter’s art
was principally confined to the manufacture of common domestic
vessels—large coarse dishes, cruiskens, tygs, pitchers, bowls, cups,
candlesticks, pans, butter-pots, and other articles being among the
number. Many articles, not made in England, were imported from Holland
and other countries, and came into general use. They were, however,
soon copied by our own workmen and made to a large extent. Among the
principal of the imported vessels were bellarmines, or grey beards; and
ale-pots. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, one William Simpson proposed
to manufacture, “in some decayed town within this realm,” these
ale-pots, which had till that time been solely imported from Cologne by
Garnet Tynes, by which he promised that “manie a hundred poore men may
be sett at worke.” As a preliminary to this, he petitioned the queen to
grant him sole licence to bring them into the realm. The following is
his petition:—<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The sewte of William Simpson, merchaunte—Whereas one Garnet
Tynes, a straunger livinge in Acon, in the parte beyond the
seas, being none of her ma<sup>ties</sup> subjecte, doth buy uppe
alle the pottes made at Culloin, called <i>Drinking stone
pottes</i>, and he onelie transporteth them into this realm
of England, and selleth them: It may please your ma<sup>tie</sup> to
graunt unto the said Simpson full power and onelie license
to provyde transport and bring into this realm the same or
such like drinking pottes; and the said Simpson will putt
in good suretie that it shall not be prejudiciall to anie
of your ma<sup>ties</sup> subjects, but that he will serve them as
plentifullie, and sell them at as reasonable price as the other
hath sold them from tyme to tyme.</p>

<p>“Item. He will be bound to double her ma<sup>ties</sup> custome by the
year, whenever it hath been at the most.</p>

<p>“Item. He will as in him lieth draur the making of such like
pottes into some decayed town within this realm, wherebie manie
a hundred poore men may be sett a work.</p>

<p>“Note. That no Englishman doth transport any potte into this
realm but onlie the said Garnet Tynes, who also serveth all the
Low Countries and other places with pottes.”</p>
</div>

<p>Whether the petition was granted or not does not appear.</p>

<p>In 1570, according to Stow, Jasper Andries and Jacob Janson, potters,
who had settled in Norwich in 1567 (which see), “removed to London.
They set forth in a petition to Queen Elizabeth that they were the
first that brought in and exercised the said science in this realm, and
were at great charges before they could find materials in this realm.
They besseeched her, in recompense of their great cost and charges,
that she would grant them house room in or without the liberties of
London, by the water side.” In 1626 a patent was granted to Thomas
Rous, <i>alias</i> Rius, and Abraham Cullen, for the manufacture of
“Stone Potts, Stone Juggs, and Stone Bottells.” This patent I here give
entire:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In 1635 a patent was granted to “David Ramsey, Esquier, one of the
groomes of our pryvie chamber, Michael Arnold, and John Ayliffe,
of the citty of Westminster, Brewers,” for a new method of heating
boilers by means of sea coal, for brewers, soap-boilers, and others;
which “invencion is alsoe very usefull for the Dryeinge of Bricke,
all manner of Tyles, and all such sortes of Tyles as cannot be made
in this kingdome but in the Heat of Sumer; and alsoe that they have
found out the Arte and Skill of Makeinge and Dyeinge of all sortes of
Panne Tyles, Stone Juggs, Bottles of all sizes, Earthen Wicker Bottles;
Meltinge Pottes for Gouldsmythes, and other Earthen Comodityes within
this our Realme, which nowe are made by Straungers in Forraigne Partes;
and that in the makinge of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span> same Earthen Comodityes as aforesaid,
the saide David Ramsey, Michaell Arnold, and John Ayliffe shall have
employment for many of our poore Subjects, whoe thereby shalbee sett on
worke, and bee competently mainteyned, and will alsoe sell them cheaper
than they are now sould.” This patent was for fourteen years, the
parties being bound to pay one-fourth part of their profit yearly into
the exchequer.</p>

<p>The stoneware was usually called “Cologne ware,” from Cologne, from
whence it was first imported; and by this name that made in our own
country continued to be in great measure known. It will be well here,
therefore, to speak of the ale-pots and bellarmines of that kind of
ware.</p>

     <p class="p0 center sm">Fig. 314.—Bellarmine.</p>
  </div>

<p>The <i>Bellarmine</i>, or <i>Grey Beard</i>, or <i>Long Beard</i>, as
it was commonly called, was a stoneware pot of bottle form, mostly with
a handle at the back and ornament on the front. The neck is narrow, and
the lower part, or “belly,” as it is technically called, very wide and
protuberant. They were in very general use at the “ale-houses” to serve
ale in to customers, and were of different sizes—the <i>gallonier</i>
containing a gallon; the <i>pottle pot</i>, two quarts; the <i>pot</i>,
a quart; and the <i>little pot</i>, a pint. These jugs were derisively
named after Cardinal Bellarmine, who died in 1621. The cardinal having,
by his determined and bigoted opposition to the reformed religion, made
himself obnoxious in the Low Countries, became naturally an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span> object of
derision and contempt with the Protestants, who, among other modes of
showing their detestation of the man, seized on the potter’s art to
exhibit his short stature, his hard features, and his rotund figure,
to become the jest of the ale-house and the byword of the people.
Allusions to the bellarmines are very common in the productions of the
English writers of the period.</p>

<p>Ben Jonson, in his <i>Gipsies Metamorphosed</i>, gives the following
amusing version of the origin of these vessels:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Gaze upon this brave spark struck out of Flintshire upon
Justice Jug’s daughter, then sheriff of the county, who,
running away with a kinsman of our captain’s, and her father
pursuing her to the Marches, he great with justice, she great
with jugling, they were both for the time turned into stone
upon sight of each other here in Chester; till at last (see the
wonder!) a jug of the town ale reconciling them, the memorial
of both their gravities—his in beard, and hers in belly—hath
remained ever since preserved in picture upon the most stone
jugs of the kingdom.”</p>
</div>

<p>In another place he says:—</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
   <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">“Whose, at the best, some round grown thing, a <i>jug</i></div>
        <div><i>Faced with a beard</i>, that fills out to the guests.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>In another play, the <i>Ordinary</i>, is the following:—</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
   <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i10">“Thou thing,</div>
        <div>Thy belly looks like to some strutting hill,</div>
        <div>O’ershadowed by thy rough beard like a wood;</div>
        <div>Or like a larger jug that some men call</div>
        <div>A <i>Bellarmine</i>, but we a <i>Conscience</i>;</div>
        <div>Whereon the lewder hand of pagan workman</div>
        <div>Over the proud ambitious head hath carved</div>
        <div>An idol large, with beard episcopal,</div>
        <div>Making the vessel look like tyrant Eglon.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>In the curious play of <i>Epsom Wells</i>, one of the characters, while
busy with ale, says, “Uds bud, my head begins to turn round; but let’s
into the house. ’Tis dark. We’ll have one <i>Bellarmine</i> there, and
then <i>Bonus nocius</i>.”</p>

<p>These are but a few of the allusions that might be brought forward
from the old writers, but they are sufficient to show its common
use. The ale pots thus being formed with the corpulent proportions
and the “hard-mouthed visage” of the cardinal, became a popular and
biting burlesque upon him. From them, too, from the face upon the ale
<i>mug</i> or ale pot, the vulgar name of “mug” for the human face
is probably derived. The engravings, Figs. <a href="#image092a">312 to 314</a>, show three
bellarmines; the first two are “foreign” make, but the latter is
English; and a strong general resemblance will be seen to the pitchers
before engraved. Another English bellarmine is engraved under the head
of “Fulham.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span></p>

<p>The ordinary “ale-pots,” or “little pots,”—the pint jugs,—were,
like the bellarmines, at first imported into this country, but they
were afterwards made to a considerable extent in various parts of the
kingdom. They were made of a light-coloured clay, and took the name of
“stoneware,” from their hardness and colour. They were turned on the
wheel, the necks being usually covered, with deeply encircling lines;
and the ornaments consisted of lines scratched, or incised, into the
soft clay with a sharp point, in form of foliage, flowers, scrolls,
circles, &amp;c., and then washed in with blue colour. In some instances a
pattern—usually a flower or initials—was impressed, from a mould, on
the front, as in the manner of the bellarmines. They are generally very
thick, and must have been extremely durable. One example is engraved
(Fig. <a href="#image094">315</a>).</p>

  </div>

<p>Salt-glazing appears to have been introduced about 1680, and it
gradually superseded the lead-glazing which till that time was in
regular use. The account given of this discovery is, that “at Mr.
Joseph Yates’, Stanley, near Bagnall, five miles east of Burslem, in
Staffordshire, the servant was preparing, in an earthen vessel, a
salt-ley for curing pork, and during her temporary absence the liquid
boiled over, and the sides of the pot were quickly red hot from intense
heat; yet, when cold, were covered with an excellent glaze. The fact
was detailed to Mr. Palmer, potter, of Bagnall, who availed himself
of the occurrence, and told other potters. At the small manufactories
in Holden Lane (Adams’s), Green Head, and Brownhills (Wedgwood’s),
salt-glazed ware was soon afterwards made.” “The ovens employed for the
purpose being used only once weekly, and the ware being cheap, were
large in diameter, and very high, to contain a sufficient quantity
to be baked each time, to cover all contingent expenses. They were
constructed with a scaffold round them, on which the firemen could
stand, while casting in the salt through holes made in the upper part
of the cylinder, above the bags or inner vertical flues; and the
saggers were made of completely refractory materials, with holes in
their sides, for the vapourised salt to circulate freely among all the
vessels in the oven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span> to affect their surfaces.” The ware thus glazed,
and made from the common clay, with a mixture of fine sand from Mole
Cop, was called “Crouch ware,” and in this all the ordinary articles
of domestic use, including jugs, cups, dishes, &amp;c., were made. At this
time, it is stated, there were only twenty-two ovens in Burslem and
its neighbourhood. “The employment of salt in glazing Crouch ware was
a long time practised before the introduction of white clay and flint.
The vast volumes of smoke and vapours from the ovens entering the
atmosphere, produced that dense white cloud which, from about eight
o’clock till twelve on the Saturday morning (the time of ‘firing up,’
as it is called), so completely enveloped the whole interior of the
town, as to cause persons often to run against each other, travellers
to mistake the road; and strangers have mentioned it as extremely
disagreeable, and not unlike the smoke of Etna or Vesuvius.”</p>

<p>In 1685 a white stoneware was made at Shelton by Thomas Miles, and at
the same time and place a brown stoneware was also made. These would be
the same as the ale-pots and bellarmines were made of.</p>

<p>In 1686, Dr. Plot published his “Staffordshire,” and thus spoke of the
butter trade, and butter-pots then made:—<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“From which Limestone Hills, and rich pastures and meddows,
the great Dairys are maintained in this part of Staffordshire,
that supply Uttoxeter Mercat with such vast quantites of good
butter and cheese, that the Cheesemongers of London have
thought it worth their while to set up a Factorage here for
these commodities, which are brought in from this, and the
neighbouring county of Derby, in so great plenty, that the
Factors many Mercat days (in the season) lay out no less than
five hundred pounds a day in these two commodities only. The
Butter they buy by the <i>Pot</i> of a long cylendrical form,
made at <i>Burslem</i>, in this county, of a certain size, so
as not to weigh above six pounds at most, and yet to contain at
least 14 pounds of Butter, according to an Act of Parliament
made about 14 or 16 years agoe, for regulateing the abuses
of this trade in the make of Pots, and false packing of the
Butter; which before was sometimes layed good for a little
depth at the <i>top</i>, and bad at the <i>bottom</i>; and
sometimes set in <i>rolls</i> only touching at the <i>top</i>,
and standing hollow <i>below</i> at a great distance from the
sides of the pot. To prevent these little Moorlandish cheats
(than whom no people whatever are esteemed most subtile) the
Factors keep a <i>Surveyor</i> all the Summer here, who if
he have ground to suspect any of the <i>Pots</i>, tryes them
with an instrument of Iron, made like a <i>Cheese-Taster</i>,
only much larger and longer, called an <i>Auger</i> or
<i>Butter-boare</i>, with which he makes proof (thrusting it
in <i>obliquely</i>) to the bottom of the Pot: so that they
<i>weigh</i> none (which would be an endless business) or
very seldom; nor do they <i>bore</i> it neither, where they
know their customer to be a constant fair dealer. But their
<i>Cheese</i> which comes but little, if anything short of that
of Cheshire, they sell by weight as at other places.”</p>
</div>

<p>In reference to this, the Historian of Uttoxeter says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Butter-pots are mentioned in the parochial records of the town
forty years before Dr. Plot wrote; for five pots of butter were
sent from Uttoxeter to the garrison of Tutbury Castle, and had
been bought at the sum of 12<i>s.</i> As this was seventeen
years before the Act of Parliament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span> for the regulation of the
sale of butter in pots, it is difficult from this to judge of
the exact price of butter per pound at Uttoxeter at that remote
period. And yet it may be reasonably inferred that the pots of
1644 were of the size of those manufactured after 1661; for
it appears the Act was passed more for the prevention of any
irregularity in the size of the pots, and the mode of packing
butter in them, than for any actual alteration of the size the
pots were understood to be. If so, butter then at Uttoxeter
was worth but about twopence a pound, supposing the five pots
of butter sent to Tutbury, costing 12<i>s.</i>, contained
fourteen pounds of butter each. About fifty years before butter
was retailed throughout the kingdom at sevenpence per pound;
but this was regarded as an enormous price, which, Stowe
says, ‘was a judgment for their sins.’ It is highly probable,
therefore, that the pots contained fourteen pounds of butter,
which consequently was twopence per pound at Uttoxeter when the
five pots were bought, especially as it corresponds with the
price of cheese at that time in the town, as to which the old
parochial accounts have preserved very distinct information,
the sum of £7 15<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> having been paid for 8
cwt. 2 qrs. 7 lbs., which was also for the besieged at Tutbury.”</p>

<p>The butter pots were tall cylindrical vessels, of coarse clay, and very
imperfectly baked. They are now of great rarity, but specimens may be
seen in the Hanley Museum and in the Museum of Practical Geology. Their
form will be seen in Fig. <a href="#image096">316</a>. It is worthy of remark that even yet,
as it was in Shaw’s days, Irish or Dutch butter, which is generally
imported in casks, and is in most places known as “tub butter,” is, in
the potteries, usually called “pot butter.”</p>

  </div>

<p>Of the state of the Staffordshire potteries at this period, the latter
half of the seventeenth century, Dr. Plot gives a most interesting and
valuable account, in which he shows not only what clays were then used,
but also speaks of the glazes, and describes the modes of manufacture
of some of the vessels. The clays, it appears, were mostly procured
from the coal measures, and fine sand to temper and mix with them was
procured from Baddeley Edge, Mole Cop, and other places. The following
is Dr. Plot’s account:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“25. Other potter’s clays for the more common wares there
are at many other places, particularly at Horsley Heath, in
the parish of Tipton; in Monway field above mentioned, where
there are two sorts gotten, one of a yellowish colour, mixt
with white, the other blewish; the former stiff and heavy,
the other more friable and light, which, mixt together, work
better than apart. Of these they make divers sorts of vessels
at Wednesbury, which they paint with slip, made of a reddish
sort of earth gotten at Tipton. But the greatest pottery
they have in this county is carried on at Burslem, near
Newcastle-under-Lyme, where for making their different sorts of
pots they have as many different sorts of clay, which they dig
round about the towne, all within half a mile’s distance, the
best being found nearest the coale, and are distinguish’t by
their colours and uses as followeth:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“1. <i>Bottle clay</i>, of a bright whitish streaked
yellow colour.</p>

<p>“2. <i>Hard fire-clay</i>, of a duller whitish colour,
and fully intersperst with a dark yellow, which they
use for their <i>black wares</i>, being mixt with the</p>

<p>“3. <i>Red blending clay</i>, which is of a dirty red
colour.</p>

<p>“4. <i>White clay</i>, so called it seems, though of
a blewish colour, and used for making yellow-colour’d
ware, because yellow is the lightest colour they make
any ware of.</p>

<p>All which they call <i>throwing</i> clays, because they
are of a closer texture, and will work on the wheel.</p>
</div>

<p>“26. Which none of the three other clays they call <i>Slips</i>
will any of them doe, being of looser and more friable natures;
these, mixt with water, they make into a consistence thinner
than a Syrup, so that being put into a bucket it will run
out through a Quill. This they call <i>Slip</i>, and is the
substance wherewith they <i>paint</i> their wares, whereof the</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“1. Sort is called the <i>Orange Slip</i>, which,
before it is work’t, is of a greyish colour, mixt with
orange balls, and gives the ware (when annealed) an
orange colour.</p>

<p>“2. The <i>White Slip</i>: this, before it is work’t,
is of a dark blewish colour, yet makes the ware yellow,
which, being the <i>lightest</i> colour they make any
of, they call it, as they did the clay above, the
<i>white slip</i>.</p>

<p>“3. The <i>Red Slip</i>, made of a dirty reddish clay,
which gives ware a black colour.</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">Neither of which clays or slips must have any sand
or gravel in them. Upon this account, before it be brought to
the wheel, they prepare the clay by steeping it in water in a
square pit till it be of a due consistence; then they bring
it to their beating board, where, with a long <i>Spatula</i>,
they beat it till it be well mixt; then, being first made into
great <i>squarish</i> rolls, it is brought to the <i>wageing
board</i>, where it is slit into thin flat pieces with a
<i>wire</i>, and the least stones or gravel pick’t out of it.
This being done, they <i>wage</i> it, <i>i.e.</i> knead or
mould it like <i>bread</i>, and make it into round <i>balls</i>
proportionable to their work; and then ’tis brought to the
wheel, and formed as the workman sees good.</p>

<p>“27. When the potter has wrought the clay either into hollow
or flat ware, they set it abroad to dry in faire weather, but
by the fire in foule; turning them as they see occasion, which
they call <i>whaving</i>. When they are dry they <i>stouk</i>
them, <i>i.e.</i> put ears and handles to such vessels as
require them. These also being dry, they <i>slip</i> or
<i>paint</i> them, with their severall sorts of slip, according
as they designe their work; when the first slip is dry, laying
on the others at their leisure, the <i>orange slip</i> makeing
the ground, and the <i>white</i> and <i>red</i> the paint;
which two colours they break with a <i>wire brush</i>, much
after the manner they doe when they <i>marble</i> paper, and
then <i>cloud</i> them with a <i>pencil</i> when they are
pretty dry. After the vessels are painted they <i>lead</i> them
with that sort of <i>Lead Ore</i> they call <i>Smithum</i>,
which is the smallest <i>ore</i> of all, beaten into dust,
finely sifted, and strewed upon them; which gives them the
<i>gloss</i>, but not the colour; all the colours being
chiefly given by the variety of slips, except the <i>motley
colour</i>, which is procured by blending the <i>Lead</i> with
<i>Manganese</i>, by the workmen call’d <i>Magnus</i>. But when
they have a mind to shew the utmost of their skill in giving
their wares a fairer gloss than ordinary, they lead them then
with lead calcined into powder, which they also sift fine and
strew upon them as before, which not only gives them a higher
gloss, but goes much further too in their work than the lead
ore would have done.</p>

<p>“28. After this is done they are carried to the oven, which
is ordinarily above 8 foot high, and about 6 foot wide, of a
round copped forme, where they are placed one upon another
from the bottom to the top; if they be ordinary wares, such
as <i>cylindricall butter-pots</i>, &amp;c., that are not leaded,
they are exposed to the <i>naked</i> fire, and so is all their
<i>flat ware</i>, though it be leaded, having only <i>parting
shards</i>, <i>i.e.</i> thin bits of old pots, put between
them to keep them from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span> sticking together; but if they be
<i>leaded hollow wares</i>, they doe not expose them to the
<i>naked</i> fire, but put them in <i>shragers</i>, that is,
in coarse metall’d pots made of <i>marle</i> (not <i>clay</i>)
of divers formes, according as their wares require, in which
they put commonly three pieces of clay, called <i>Bobbs</i>,
for the ware to stand on, to keep it from sticking to the
<i>shragers</i>; as they put them in the <i>shragers</i>,
to keep them from sticking to one another (which they would
certainly otherwise doe by reason of the leading), and to
preserve them from the vehemence of the fire, which else would
melt them downe, or at least warp them. In twenty-four hours
an oven of pots will be burnt; then they let the fire goe out
by degrees, which in ten hours more will be perfectly done,
and then they draw them for sale, which is chiefly to the poor
<i>Crate-men</i>, who carry them at their backs all over the
countrey, to whome they reckon them by the piece, <i>i.e.</i>
<i>Quart</i>, in <i>hollow ware</i>, so that six pottle, or
three gallon <i>bottles</i>, make a <i>dozen</i>, and so more
or less to a <i>dozen</i> as they are of greater or lesser
content. The <i>flat wares</i> are also reckoned by pieces
and dozens, but not (as the <i>hollow</i>) according to their
<i>content</i>, but their different <i>bredths</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>A round dish of the “combed ware,” or marbled or mottled ware,
described by Plot, is shown on Fig. <a href="#image098">317</a>. Some of the examples I have
seen are exceedingly delicate and minute in their patterns; others, as
the engraving, have been “combed” with a coarse comb or wire brush. The
lead for glazing, named by Plot, was procured from the Derbyshire lead
mines—the ore being powdered, or “punned,” and dusted on to the soft
clay vessel before firing.</p>

<p>Previous to this, in 1671, John Dwight took out a patent in the
petition for which he stated that “he had discovered the Mistery of
Transparent Earthen Ware, comonly knowne by the Names of Porcelaine
or China and Persian Ware, as alsoe the Misterie of the Stone Ware
vulgarly called Cologne Ware; and that he designed to introduce a
Manufacture of the said Wares into our Kingdome of Englande, where they
have not hitherto been wrought or made.” This was the origin of the
famous Fulham works, a full account of which will be given in another
part of this volume.</p>

<p>In 1676 John Ariens Van Hamme, “in pursuance of the incouragement he
hath received from our Ambassadour at the Hague, is come over to settle
in this our kingdome with his family, to exercise his ‘Art of makeing
Tiles and Porcelaine and other Earthen Wares, after the way practised
in Holland,’ which hath not beene practised in this our kingdome,” took
out a patent for fourteen years for the sole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span> practice of his art. The
“tiles” named in his patent would, of course, be the “Dutch Tiles”
as they were always called, and which were used for the lining of
rooms, the decoration of fire-places, and for various other purposes.
They were about four inches square, made of a common kind of clay,
and faced, as all delf ware was, with a fine white slip. On this was
painted a pattern—a group of figures, the illustration of some sacred
or profane story, foliage, birds, or other devices, in blue colour,
and then glazed and fired. On one of these tiles is represented a lady
letting her lover down from her chamber into the street below, by a
rope which she holds in her hand, and others have various devices.
The manufacture of these tiles was carried on largely in England, and
further notices will be given under the head of Liverpool, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In 1684 John Dwight, having represented “that by his owne industry
and at his owne proper costes and charges hee hath invented and sett
vp at Fulham, in our County of Middlx, “Severall New Manufactures of
Earthenwares, called by the names of White Gorges, Marbled Porcellane
Vessels, Statues, and Figures, and Fine Stone Gorges and Vessells
never before made in England or elsewhere; and alsoe discovered the
Mistery of Transparent Porcellane, and Opacous, Redd, and Dark coloured
Porcellane or China and Persian Wares, and the Mistery of the Cologne
or Stone Wares, and is endeavouring to settle manufactures of all the
said wares within this our kingdome of England,” had another patent
for fourteen years granted to him. To Dwight, therefore, it will be
seen by these patents, the credit of being the first inventor and maker
of porcelain in England belongs. His name is thus one entitled to
lasting honour as the pioneer of one of the best, most beautiful, most
successful, and most flourishing arts ever practised in our kingdom.</p>

  </div>

<p>In 1688 the brothers Eler or Elers, traditionally believed to have been
potters from Holland, are said to have come over with William, Prince
of Orange (William III.), to England at the time of the “Glorious
Revolution,” and, two years later, to have settled at Bradwell and
Dimsdale, not far from Burslem, in Staffordshire, where they erected
kilns and commenced the making of a fine red ware (probably the kind
spoken of by Dwight), in imitation of foreign red porcelain, from a
vein of clay which, by some means, they had discovered existed at
this spot. Here they produced remarkably fine and good red ware, of
compact and hard texture, good colour,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span> and of very characteristic and
excellent designs. They were men of much skill and taste, and their
productions so closely resemble those of Japan as to be occasionally
mistaken for them. An example, from the Museum of Practical Geology,
is here shown. The Elers, besides the red ware, also produced an
exceedingly good Egyptian black, by a mixture of manganese with the
clay; and this was the precursor and origin of the fine black bodies
of Josiah Wedgwood and others. “Their extreme precaution,” says Shaw,
“to keep secret their processes, and jealousy lest they might be
accidentally witnessed by any purchaser of their wares—making them
at Bradwell, and conveying them over the fields to Dimsdale, there
to be sold, being only two fields distant from the turnpike road,
and having some means of communication (believed to be earthenware
pipes, like those for water) laid in the ground between the two
contiguous farmhouses, to intimate the approach of persons supposed
to be intruders—caused them to experience considerable and constant
annoyance. In vain did they adopt measures for self-protection in
regard to their manipulations, by employing an idiot to turn the
thrower’s wheel, and the most ignorant and stupid workmen to perform
the laborious operations, and by locking up these persons while at
work, and strictly examining each prior to quitting the manufactory
at night—all their most important processes were however developed,
and publicly stated for general benefit. Mortified at the failure of
all their precaution, disgusted at the prying inquisitiveness of their
Burslem neighbours, and fully aware that they were too far distant
from the principal market for their productions—even had not other
kinds of porcelain been announced, which probably would diminish their
sales—about 1710 they discontinued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span> their Staffordshire manufactory,
and removed to Lambeth or Chelsea (where is at this day a branch of
the family), and connected the interests of their new manufactory with
those of a glass manufacture, established in 1676 by Venetians, under
the auspices of the Duke of Buckingham. Others, however, have stated
that their removal was consequent on misunderstanding and persecution
because their oven cast forth such tremendous volumes of smoke and
flame, during the time of glazing, as were terrific to the inhabitants
of Burslem, and caused all its (astonishing number of <i>eight</i>)
master potters to hurry in dismay to Bradwell.”</p>

<p>The two potters who had wormed out the secret of the Elers were named
Astbury and Twyford, and they are said each to have commenced business
on his own account at Shelton, and to have made “<span class="smcap">Red</span>,”
“<span class="smcap">Crouch</span>,” and “<span class="smcap">White stone</span>” wares from native clays,
using salt glaze for some of the vessels, and lead ore for others. It
is interesting to add that the oven erected and used by the Elers was
in existence as late as the beginning of the present century, and that
the place, in an old account-book in my possession, is called “the
Eller field.”</p>

<p>About the period when Dwight was taking out his patent, Thomas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span> Toft
and Ralph Toft were making, in Staffordshire, some large domestic
dishes, which, from some of them bearing their names, put on in large
letters, are universally known to collectors as “Toft Dishes.” Under
this name, however, it is well to state many dishes and other vessels
pass which never were, or could have been, made by them, and I warn
collectors against too easily pinning their faith to a belief that
their examples are genuine “Tofts” unless they bear the name. The
style was common to all makers of that date. Besides dishes, tygs of
various forms, with one, two, three, or four handles; pitchers of
various sizes, candlesticks, posset-pots, gossips’ bowls, pans or
pancheons, utensils for the chamber, and many other articles, were made
of precisely the same coarse materials, and of exactly the same kind of
decoration as the dishes.</p>

  </div>

<p>The material of these pots is a coarse reddish or buff-coloured clay,
and the ornaments are laid on in different coloured clays, and the
whole is then glazed thickly over. One of these large dishes, now in
the Museum of Practical Geology, is shown on Fig. <a href="#image102">321</a>. The body is
of buff-coloured clay, with the ornaments laid on in relief in light
and dark brown. The border is trellised, and in the centre is a lion
rampant, crowned. On the rim beneath the lion is the name of the maker,
THOMAS TOFT. In the same museum is a fragment of another similar dish,
with a lion and unicorn. A very fine dish of a similar kind, and by
the same maker, in the Bateman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span> Museum is engraved on Fig. <a href="#image101">320</a>. It
is twenty-two inches in diameter, and bears a half-length crowned
portrait of King Charles, with sceptre in each hand, and the initials
C.R. Below the figure, on the rim, which, as usual, is trellised in
red and black, is the name THOMAS TOFT. In the same museum is another
remarkably fine dish, bearing two full-length figures in the costume
of the Stuarts, the gentleman holding in his hand his hat and feather,
and having “petticoat breeches,” tied stockings, and high-heeled boots
with ties, and the lady holding a bunch of flowers. Between the figures
are the initials W. T., and on the rim at the bottom, in precisely the
same manner as the Toft dishes, is the name WILLIAM: TALOR. Another
Toft dish (Fig. <a href="#image103">322</a>) now in the possession of Mr. Bagshawe, is nineteen
inches in diameter, and bears a female figure, and two heads in ovals,
with foliage, &amp;c., and the name RALPHOFT, or Ralph Toft, the H and
T being apparently conjoined. The ground is buff, and the ornaments
are laid on in dark and light brown clay. Another with the name RALPH
TOFT, 1677, was in the Reynolds’ collection.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span> Another maker of this
period, whose name occurs in the same manner as those just described,
was WILLIAM SANS. Of the makers of these dishes, it is interesting to
observe that Toft is an old name connected with the pottery district,
and that members of the family are still potters in the neighbourhood.
It is also an old Derbyshire name, being connected with Youlgreave and
other places in that neighbouring county.</p>

<p>The “Tygs” appear to have been made in considerable numbers, and,
indeed, to have constituted one of the staple manufactures of the
potters of that day. They were the ordinary drinking-cups of the
period, and were made with one, two, three, four, or more handles.
The two-handled ones are said to have been “parting cups,” and those
with three or four handles “loving cups,” being so arranged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span> that
three or four persons drinking out of one, and each using a different
handle, brought their lips to different parts of the rim. Examples of
some of the forms of these tygs are shown on Figs. <a href="#image104a">323 to 328</a>. Two of
these, with three handles each (Figs. <a href="#image104c">326</a> and <a href="#image104e">328</a>), were found in a
long-disused lead mine at Great Hucklow; another (Fig. <a href="#image104d">327</a>) has three
handles and a spout, and is ornamented with bosses of a lighter colour,
bearing a swan, a flower, and a spread eagle. The fourth (Figs. <a href="#image104a">323</a>
and <a href="#image104a">324</a>) are two-handled cups, of the same general form as those with
one handle. These two latter specimens are in the Museum of Practical
Geology. Other examples of various forms are shown on the remaining
engravings.</p>

<p>A curious candlestick, shown on Fig. <a href="#image105a">329</a>, in the Museum of Practical
Geology, is of much the same kind of ware as the tygs, and has its
ornaments in white clay slip; it bears the date 1649, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span> the initials
E. M. Another, in my own collection (Fig. <a href="#image105b">330</a>), is made of precisely
the same coarse kind of ware as the tygs; dark reddish brown, with
ornaments in white slip—the slip at the base having been laid on in a
broad band, and then scratched through to the dark clay. The mug, Fig.
<a href="#image105c">331</a>, is exactly the same kind of ware.</p>

<p>Another curious article of this same kind of ware, in the Bateman
collection, is engraved on Fig. <a href="#image105d">332</a>. It is a small earthenware cradle
of excellent form, and elaborately ornamented; the ground is a rich
reddish brown, the ornaments of buff and black. It bears the date
on its top of 1693, and is 7¾ inches long, and 4¾ inches in height.
To this period belongs the interesting puzzle-jug in the Museum of
Practical Geology, shown on Fig. <a href="#image106a">333</a>. It is of brown ware, and bears
the name, incised in writing letters, of “John Wedgwood, 1691,” and is
the first and earliest example of the name of Wedgwood occurring on
pottery. It will again be referred to later on.</p>

<p>It is very clear that brown ware of the same general character as the
tygs and the Toft dishes, was made in very many parts of the country
besides Staffordshire, and that much now by collectors appropriated to
that county has no connection with it.</p>

  </div>

<p>At the commencement of the eighteenth century, the ceramic art in
this country was beginning to expand in a remarkable degree, and many
important strides for its improvement were taken. The brown-ware
dishes, tygs, and other vessels for domestic use, were still made as
before, and stoneware bottles, ale pots, and other articles continued
to be produced; but, beyond these, some much finer kinds of earthenware
were introduced, which gradually took their place. Among these were
Delft ware and Crouch ware, to which I have referred, and the white
ware, which has frequently, but erroneously, been called “Elizabethan
ware,” which was probably introduced about this time. A good specimen
of the brown ware of this period, which will be seen to be identical in
character with the dishes and tygs and cradle before spoken of, is the
posset pot shown on Fig. <a href="#image107a">336</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span> It bears the loyal motto, “GOD : SAVE :
THE : QVEEN : 1711,” and is ornamented in the usual way with slip. It is
of much the same character as a wassail or gossips’ bowl, bearing the
name “RICHARD MEIR,” in the Liverpool Museum. It is shown on Fig. <a href="#image107b">337</a>.
The form of Fig. <a href="#image107a">336</a> is somewhat different from the usual later shape
of posset pots, as will be shown on engravings which will follow. As
posset and posset pots are local matters, a few words concerning them
will here be interesting. Posset pots have been made and regularly used
in Derbyshire and the neighbouring counties from an early period until
the present time. “Posset” is an excellent mixture of hot ale, milk,
sugar, spices, and sippets, or, perhaps, more correctly speaking, dice,
of bread or oat-cake. In these counties this beverage was formerly
almost, if not quite, universal for supper on Christmas-eve; and
the “posset pot” was thus used but once a year, and often became an
heirloom in the family. A small silver coin and the wedding-ring of the
mistress of the family were generally dropped into the posset when the
guests were assembled, and those who partook of it took each a spoonful
in turn as the “pot” was handed round. Whichever of the party fished
up the coin was considered certain of good luck in the coming year,
while an early and happy marriage was believed to be the enviable fate
of the lucky individual who fished up the ring. Other posset pots will
be found engraved in other parts of this volume, under the heads of
Nottingham and Brampton.</p>

<p>It is clear that about this time the art of pot-making began to make
rapid strides; for in the space of twenty-seven years—from 1722
to 1749—no less than nine separate patents were taken out, and
were followed in rapid succession by others. In 1722, Richard Holt
and Samuel London, gentlemen, took out a patent for “a certain new
composicon or mixture (without any sort of clay) for making of white
ware, which is formed and moulded in a method hitherto not known or
practised, and far surpasses the finest of delf ware, or any other sort
made in any part of Europe, and also by their new method of impression
make the fabrick of earthenware of a more exquisite shape than the
present method of turning could ever perform or arrive to, by which
meanes our subjects will be able to excell all Europe, and not only
employ a great many of our own poor, to the great benefit of trade
and the manufactures of our kingdom, but also prevent the clandestine
running of delf ware, &amp;c., from foreign parts into Great Brittain;”
granted “for the term of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span> fourteen years.” It does not say of what
materials the composition is made, except that it is without any sort
of clay, nor does it describe any method of impression.</p>

<p>In the same year, Thomas Billin, having “by many long, laborious, and
chargeable experiments found out and invented a method for making the
most refined earthenware, with help of clay and other materials found
within this kingdom, which ever yet appeared in this part of Europe, of
a nature and composicon, not only transparent, but so perfect in its
kind, and of principles so firmly vnited, as (contrary to the nature of
all other earthenwares) to resist almost any degree of heat, by which
qualities it is more valuable, and of greater vse and ornament than all
other kinds ever yet invented or practised in this kingdom, and capable
of being wrought into vessels and ornaments for any vse; and for the
working of the same invention he hath invented particular and proper
engines and tools.” No description is given of the mode of manufacture,
or of the engines or tools mentioned in the title of the invention.</p>

<p>In 1724 Robert Redrich and Thomas Jones had a patent granted them
for “a new art or method, as well for staining, veining, spotting,
clouding, damasking, or otherwise imitating the various kinds of
marble, porphyry, and other rich stones, and tortoiseshell, on wood,
stone, and earthenware, and all and every such goods, wares, utensils,
and things as are made, cut, or fashioned thereout, as for the making,
marbling, veining, spotting, staining, clouding, and damasking any
linen, silks, canvas, paper, and leather.”</p>

<p>In 1726, and again in 1732, patents were taken out for methods of
grinding flints, &amp;c., which were of much importance. The first of
these, by Thomas Benson, is described as “an engine or new method for
the more expeditious working the said flint stone, whereby all the
said hazards and inconveniences attending the same will effectually
be prevented.” It is stated that in the making of “white pots,”
flint stone is “the chief ingredient,” and that the method hitherto
used in preparing it “has been by pounding or breaking it dry, and
afterwards sifting it through fine lawns, which has proved very
destructive to mankind;” and this invention is to obviate it, and is as
follows:—The flint stones are first wetted, then crushed as fine as
sand by two large wheels, of the bigness and shape of mill-stones, of
iron, and made to turn upon the edges by the power of a water-wheel.
This material is afterwards conveyed into large circular iron pans,
“in which there are large iron balls, which, by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span> power of the
water-wheel above named, are swiftly driven round: in a short time
the operation is concluded, and by turning a tap the material empties
itself into casks.”</p>

<p>The next one, by the same Thomas Benson, taken out in 1732, was
described as—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A new engine, or method for grinding of flint stones, being
the chief ingredient used in making of white wares, such as
pots and other vessels, a manufacture carried on in our county
of Stafford, and in some other parts of this our kingdom; that
the common method hitherto used in preparing the same hath
been by breaking and pounding the stones dry, and afterwards
sifting the powder through fine lawns, which hath proved very
destructive to mankind, occasioned by the dust suckled into the
body, which, being of a ponderous nature, fixes so closely upon
the lungs that nothing can remove it, insomuch that it is very
difficult to find persons to engage in the said manufacture, to
the great detriment and decay of that branch of trade, which
would otherwise, from the usefulness thereof, be of great
benefit and advantage to our kingdom; that by the petitioner’s
invention the flint stones are sprinkled with water, so that
no dust can arise, then ground as fine as sand, with two large
stones made to turn upon the edges by the power of a wheel,
worked either by wind, water, or horses, which is afterwards
conveyed into large stone pans, made circular, wherein are
placed large stone balls, which, by the power of such wheels
are driven round with great velocity; that, in a short time,
the flint stones so broken are reduced to an oily substance,
which, by turning on a cock, empties itself into casks provided
for that purpose; that by this invention all hazards and
inconveniences in making the said manufacture in the common way
will be effectually prevented, and in every particular tend to
the manifest improvement and advantage thereof, and preserving
the lives of our subjects imployed therein.”</p>
</div>

<p>In 1729 Samuel Bell took out a patent for fourteen years “for a new
method not hitherto practiced within Great Brittain for making of a red
marble stone ware with minerall earth, found within this kingdom, which
being firmly vnited by fire will make it capable of receiving a gloss
so beautiful as to imitate, if not to compare with rubie; that the
stone ware may be formed into vessells for any necessary vse, or into
ornaments for houses or gardens, such as jarrs, flower potts, &amp;c., it
being the most perfect of its kind, both in colour, nature, and form,
that hath ever appeared in this part of Europe;” but no specification,
to show what the mineral earth was, is given.</p>

<p>In 1733 (April 24th) Ralph Shawe, potter, of Burslem, who, like many
other potters of the district, had long adopted the improvements of Mr.
Astbury and others, took out a patent for employing “various sorts of
mineral, earth, clay, and other earthy substances, which, being mixt
and incorporated together, make up a fine body, of which a curious ware
may be made, whose outside will be of a true chocolate colour, striped
with white, and the inside white, much resembling the brown China ware,
and glazed with salt.” The <i>secret</i> was merely <i>washing</i> the
inside, and forming broad lines on the outside of the articles with
a very thick slip of flint and pipeclay.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span> “To keep his process more
secluded and secret, he was accustomed to evaporate his mixed clays on
a long trough, in a place locked up under cover, beneath which were
flues, for the heat from fire applied on the outside. This also kept
the clay free from any kind of dirt; and the idea is supposed to have
been gained from the tile-makers’ method of drying their tiles in
stoves. A pair of flower-pots, excellent specimens of this person’s
manufacture, which had been received as a present from the maker by
his wife’s grandfather, were in the author’s possession till very
recently. Mr. Shawe became so litigious and overbearing, that many of
the manufacturers were extremely uncomfortable, and prevented improving
their productions. Not content with the success he experienced, and
the prospect of speedily acquiring affluence, his excessive vanity
and insatiable avarice incited to proceedings that terminated in his
ruin. Unwilling to admit the customary practices of the business, and
to brook any appearance of competition, he was constantly objecting
to every trifling improvement as an infringement of his patent,
and threatening his neighbours with suits in equity to protect his
<i>sole</i> rights; till at length self-defence urged them to bear the
expenses of a suit he had commenced against J. Mitchell, to try the
validity of the patent, at Stafford, in 1736; and very aged persons,
whose parents were present, give the general facts of the trial:—All
the manufacturers being interested in the decision, those most
respectable were in the court. Witnesses proved Astbury’s invention and
prior usage of the practice, and a special jury of great intelligence
and wealth gave a verdict against Mr. Shawe. The learned judge, after
nullifying the patent, thus addressed the audience—“Go home, potters,
and make whatever kinds of pots you please.” The hall re-echoed with
acclamations, and the strongest ebullitions of satisfaction from the
potters, to the indescribable mortification of Mr. Shawe and his
family, who afterwards went to France, where he carried forward his
manufactory, whence some of his family returned to Burslem about 1750.”
This event is thus characteristically spoken of in native tongue, in
the “Burslem Dialogue,” by Mr. Ward:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Terrick.</i> Dust moind, Rafe, owt o’ th’ treyal at
Staffurt o’ Johnny Mutchil for makkin Rafy Shay’s patten ware?</p>

<p>“<i>Leigh.</i> Oi just remember, bu oi wur ony a big lad at
th’ teyme. It had bin mitch tawkt abaht, and when, it wur oer,
they aw toud’n wat th’ judge sed to th’ mesters—‘Gooa whomm,
potters, an mak wot soourts o’ pots yoa loiken.’ An when they
coomn to Boslem, aw th’ bells i’ Hoositon, an Stooke, an th’
tahn, wurn ringin loike hey-go-mad, aw th’ dey.”</p>
</div>

<p>The kind of ware just described was sometimes known as “bitstone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
ware,” from “bits” of stone being used to separate the pieces in the
oven. This was, of course, prior to the use of “stilts,” “triangles,”
or “cockspurs.”</p>

<p>In 1744, Edward Heylyn, in the parish of Bow, in the county of
Middlesex, merchant, and Thomas Frye, of the parish of West Ham, in
the county of Essex, painter, took out a patent, and early in the
following year enrolled their specification, for the making of china
and porcelain ware. This specification, which is deeply interesting, is
as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Whereas His most Excellent Majesty King George the Second,
by His Royal Letters Patent, under the Great Seal of Great
Britain, bearing date at Westminster, the Sixth day of
December, in the eighteenth year of His reign, reciting that
whereas we, the said Edward Heylyn and Thomas Frye, had,
by our Petition, humbly represented unto His said Majesty
that we had, at a considerable expence of time and money in
trying experiments, applyed ourselves to find out a method
for the improvement of the English earthenware, and had at
last invented and brought to perfection “<span class="smcap">A New Method of
Manufacturing a Certain Material, whereby a Ware might be made
of the same Nature or Kind, and equal to, if not exceeding in
goodness and beauty, China or Porcelain Ware imported from
Abroad</span>;” which Invention we, the Petitioners, apprehended
would be of vast advantage to the kingdom, as it would not
only save large sums of money that were yearly paid to the
Chinese and Saxons, but also imploy large numbers of men,
women, and children; and that as many and as great benefits
would arise therefrom to this nation, as from the woolen or
iron manufactories, in proportion to the numbers of people
that would be employed therein, His Majesty did therefore, of
His especial grace, certain knowledge, and meer motion, give
and grant unto us, the said Edward Heylyn and Thomas Frye, our
extors, admors, &amp; assigns, His especial licence, full power,
sole priviledge &amp; authority, to make, use, exercise, and
vend our said Invention in that part of Great Britain called
England, Dominion of Wales, and Town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, to
hold to us, the said Edward Heylyn and Thomas Frye, our extors,
admors, and assigns, for the term of fourteen years from the
date of the said recited Letters Patent. In which said Letters
Patent there is contained a provisoe, that if we, the said
Edward Heylyn and Thomas Frye, should not particularly describe
and ascertain the nature of our said Invention, and in what
manner and of what materials the same was to be performed, by
an instrument in writing, under our hands and seals, or the
hand and seal of one of us, and cause the same to be inrolled
in His Majesty’s High Court of Chancery, within four calendar
months after the date of the said recited Letters Patent; that
then the said Letters Patent, and the libertys and advantages
thereby granted, should cease and be void, as in and by the
same Letters Patent (relation being thereunto had) may more at
large appear.</p>

<p>“NOW KNOW YE, that we, the said Edward Heylyn and Thomas
Frye, in pursuance of the said provisoe, contained in the
said recited Letters Patent, do hereby describe and ascertain
the nature of our said Invention, and the manner and of what
material the same is to be performed, as hereinafter is
mentioned (that is to say):—</p>

<p>“The material is an earth, the produce of the Chirokee nation
in America, called by the natives unaker, the propertys of
which are as follows, videlicet, to be very fixed, strongly
resisting fire and menstrua, is extreamly white, tenacious,
and glittering with mica. The manner of manufacturing the said
material is as follows:—Take unaker, and by washing seperate
the sand and mica from it, which is of no use; take pott ash,
fern ash, pearl ash, kelp, or any other vegetable lixiviall
salt, one part of sands, flints, pebbles, or any other stones
of the vitryfying kind; one other part of these two principles
form a glass in the usual manner of making glass, which when
formed reduce to an impalpable powder. Then mix to one part
of this powder two parts of the washed unaker, let them be
well worked together until intimately mixed for one sort of
ware; but you may vary the proportions of the unaker and the
glass; videlicet, for some parts of porcelain you may use one
half unaker and the other half glass, and so in different
proportions, till you come to four unaker and one glass; after
which knead it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span> well together, and throw it on the wheel,
cast it into moulds, or imprint it into utensils, ornaments,
&amp;c.; those vessells, ornaments, &amp;c., that are thrown, should
be afterwards turned on a lathe and burnished, it will then
be in a situation to be put into the kiln and burned with
wood, care being taken not to discolour the ware, otherwise
the process will be much hurt. This first burning is called
biscuiting, which, if it comes out very white, is ready to be
painted blue, with lapis lazuli, lapis armenis, or zapher,
which must be highly calcined and ground very fine. It is
then to be dipt into the following glaze:—Take unaker forty
pounds, of the above glass ten pounds, mix and calcine them in
a reverberatory; then reduce, and to each pound when reduced
add two pounds of the above glass, which must be ground fine in
water, and left of a proper thickness for the ware to take up
a sufficient quantity. When the vessells, ornaments, &amp;c., are
dry, put them into the kiln in cases, burn them with a clean
wood fire, and when the glaze runs true lett out the fire, and
it is done, but must not be taken out of the kiln till it is
thorough cold.”</p>
</div>

<p>In 1748 Thomas Frye took out another patent, the specification for
which, enrolled March 17, 1749, is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“WHEREAS His most Excellent Majesty King George the Second,
by His Letters Patent under the Great Seal of Great Britain,
bearing date the Seventeenth day of November, in the
twenty-third year of His reign, did give and grant unto me,
the said Thomas Frye, His especial licence that I, the said
Thomas Frye, during the term of years therein expressed, should
and lawfully might make, use, exercise, and vend my “<span class="smcap">New
Method of Making a certain Ware, which is not Inferior in
Beauty and Fineness, and is rather Superior in Strength, than
the Earthenware that is brought from the East Indies, and
is comonly known by the Name of China, Japan, or Porcelain
Ware</span>;” in which said Letters Patent there is contained a
proviso obliging me, the said Thomas Frye, by a writing under
my hand and seal, to cause a particular description of the
nature of the said Invention, and in what manner the same is
to be performed, to be inrolled in His Majesty’s High Court of
Chancery within four kalendar months after the date of the said
recited Letters Patent, as in and by the same (relation being
thereunto had) may more at large appear.</p>

<p>“NOW KNOW YE, that in complyance with the said provisoe, I, the
said Thomas Frye, do hereby declare that the said Invention is
to be performed in the manner following (that is to say):—</p>

<p>“As there is nothing in nature but by calcination, grinding,
and washing will produce a fixed indissoluble matter,
distinguished by the name of virgin earth, the properties of
which is strictly the same whether produced from animals,
vegetables, or fossills, no other difference arising from the
process but that some bodys produce it in greater quantities
than others, as all animal substances, all fossils of the
calcarious kind, such as chalk, limestone, &amp;c.; take therefore
any of these classes, calcine it till it smokes no more, which
is an indication that all the volatile sulpherous parts are
dissipated, and that the saline are sett loose; then grind and
wash in many waters to discharge the salts and filth, reiterate
the process twice more, when the ashes or virgin earth will
be fit for use; then take of these ashes two parts, one part
of flint, or white peble, or clear sand, either producing the
same effect, which mix together with water and make into balls
or bricks, and burn them in a feirce fire, then grind it fine,
and it is ready to be mixed with one third part of its weight
of pipeclay, and temper it well, when it is fit to be thrown on
the wheel, which, when finished and dry, is to be burned as all
other pottery ware till it is transparent and of a fine colour,
then to be painted with smalt or zaffer, as it is required
to be deeper or paler, and it is ready to be glazed with the
following preparation:—Take saltpetre one part, red lead two
parts, sand, flint, or other white stones, three parts. To make
a glass, melt it well and grind it, to every twenty pounds of
which add six pounds of white lead, adding a small portion of
smalt to clean the colour; mix it well and glaze the ware,
which is done by dipping in the vessell and setting it on to
dry, when it must be put in cases and burned as above with
wood, till the surface of the ware is clear and shining, and it
is finished.”</p>
</div>

<p>In these specifications we have important materials touching the Bow
china works, under which head they will again be referred to.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span> About
this time, the Chelsea, Worcester, and Derby, and, a little later, the
Plymouth, porcelain works were established. The year in which this
specification was enrolled, 1749, is memorable as the year when Josiah
Wedgwood completed his term of apprenticeship, and when, consequently,
he entered upon that course of work and life which have ever since had
so brilliant and so marked an effect upon the potter’s art in this
country. At this time, too, there were in Staffordshire a number of
very skilful potters, who were, even before Wedgwood’s time, making
rapid strides in the art. To some of these I shall refer later on in
this work.</p>

<p>The next patent taken out was in 1762, by “William White, of Fulham,
in the county of Middlesex, potter,” for making white crucibles or
melting-pots of Stourbridge clay and Dorsetshire clay, calcined, mixed
with Woolwich sand, and water, and trodden together, and burned.
Two years later, James Williamson and Joseph Spackman patented “a
new method of turning ovals in pewter, English china, and all other
earthenwares,” on a lathe with movable chucks and sliding ring, of
their inventing. In 1766, “the Count de Lauraguais, of London,” having,
“by his petition, humbly represented unto us, that by labour, study,
travelling, and expence in trying experiments, he hath found out and
invented ‘a new method of making porcelain ware in all its different
branches, viz.—to make the coarser species of china, the more
beautiful of the Indies, and the finest of Japan, in a manner different
from any that is made in our dominions, and he, having the materials
tryed in Great Britain, has brought the same to so great perfection
that the porcelain made therewith after his new method far excells
any that has hitherto been made in Great Britain, the same not being
fusible by fire, as all other china made there is,’” took out a patent
for fourteen years, but no specification seems to have been enrolled.</p>

<p>During all this time the pottery district of Staffordshire was rapidly
increasing, and important strides were being made by its manufacturers
in the improvement of their art. In various parts of the country, too,
old pot works continued their business in an improved state, and new
ones sprang up in every direction. The history of the art, therefore,
becomes that of the various works which I shall have to pass under
review. The patents taken out from this period to the close of the
century are some guide to this state of progress, but not much; for it
is an undoubted fact, that many of the most important improvements and
most reliable inventions were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span> never patented at all, while others,
which were the gradual result of daily practice, were not sufficiently
“inventions” to entitle them to patent right.</p>

<p>In 1768 William Cookworthy, of Plymouth, took out a patent for his
newly invented porcelain, which was renewed in 1775 to Richard
Champion; to these reference will be made under the heads of “Plymouth”
and “Bristol.”</p>

<p>In 1769 Josiah Wedgwood took out his only patent; it was for
decorative, not manufacturing, processes, and will be spoken of more
fully in the notice of Etruria.</p>

<p>In 1782 James Crease patented some inventions in the making of sanitary
vessels; and in the two following years “Joseph Cartledge, of Blackley,
in the county of York, Doctor of Physic,” enrolled his specification
for “a method of glazing earthenware.” This interesting document is as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Whereas His present most Excellent Majesty King George the
Third, by His Letters Patent under the Great Seal of Great
Britain, bearing date at Westminster, the Fifth day of
February, in the twenty-fourth year of His reign, reciting
that I, the said Joseph Cartledge, had, by my Petition, humbly
represented unto His said Majesty, that I had, by great study,
invented “<span class="smcap">A New Method of Glazing Earthenware</span>,” which
would be of public utility and advantage, and praying His said
Majesty to grant unto me, my e[~x]ors, adm̃ors], and assigns,
His said Majesty’s Letters Patent for the sole exercise of
my said Invention, within England and Wales, and the Town of
Berwick-upon-Tweed, for the term of fourteen years from the
date of the said Letters Patent, was graciously pleased to
condescend to my request; in which said Letters Patent is
contained a proviso that if I, the said Joseph Cartledge,
should not particularly describe and ascertain the nature of my
said Invention, and in what manner the same is to be performed,
by an instrument in writing under my hand and seal, and cause
the same to be inrolled in his said Majesty’s High Court of
Chancery within four calendar months next and immediately after
the date of the said Letters Patent, that then the said Letters
Patent, and all liberties and advantages whatsoever thereby
granted, should utterly cease, determine, and become void, as
in and by the said Letters Patent, relation being thereunto
had, may and will more fully appear.</p>

<p>“NOW KNOW YE, that I, the said Joseph Cartledge, in compliance
with the said proviso, do hereby describe and ascertain the
nature of my said Invention and in what manner the same is to
be performed, as follows, viz.:—</p>

<p>“First, as to the nature of the Invention, it is well known to
the manufacturers of earthenware, that all the sorts of common
ware now in use are now, and have been heretofore at all times,
both in this and all other countries I know, glazed either by
sea salt, or by lead ore, or by some preparation of lead, or
of lead and tin united to ground flints or clay, or both. Now
the nature of the discovery which I have made consists in this,
that instead of the use of sea salt, or metallic substances,
the earthenware is glazed with various kinds of earths and
stones, by which there will be a great saving of expence in
the glazing of the said ware, and the glaze itself, it is
apprehended, will be more perfect than that which is made with
salt, and more wholesome than that into which either lead, or
lead and tin, enter as constituent parts.</p>

<p>“Secondly, with respect to the manner of applying the earth
and stones:—They are to be ground into powder, and laid on
the ware as potters use their own composition. With respect
to the sorts of earths and stones which are adapted to the
purposes they are various. The toad-stone of Derbyshire, and
other places, the Scotch and Guernsey pebbles, the basaltes,
and other productions generally esteemed volcanic, rag stone,
slate, shale, granite, gypsum, fluor spar, mare stone, and
many other kinds of earths and stones which I know not how
to denominate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span> will all, either severally or when mixed in
different proportions with each other, or with siliceous or
argillaceous, micaceous, or calcareous earths or stones, or
with all of them, answer the purpose. I would have it also
understood, that portions of the metallic substances now
used for the purpose of glazing earthenware or saline bodies
(tho’ not necessary for producing the effect) may be used
in conjunction with the earths and stones here mentioned. I
would further remark, that the slags of furnaces, the slags of
pit-coal, and the crust which forms on the bottom slip-kilns,
by themselves, or in conjunction with the substances before
mentioned, will glaze earthenware. But as the same effect
may be produced by a great many different sorts of earths
and stones, when used either separately or when combined in
very different proportions, all of which it is impossible
to enumerate or ascertain, I think it fit to mention the
three following, which have succeeded well with me. Take of
Derbyshire toad-stone five parts by weight, fluor spar one
part, take thirty-three parts of clay, nineteen parts of flint,
thirty-eight parts of striated gypsum, take fluor spar one,
two, three or four parts, porcelain clay two parts, siliceous
earth one fourth of a part, of calcareous earth one sixth of a
part.”</p>
</div>

<p>The next patent, in 1785, was by Thomas De-la-Mayne, for “making
buttons of burnt earth or porcelain;” and the next, in 1786, by John
Skidmore, for ornamenting various articles and “all sorts of china and
earthenware with foil stones, Bristol stones, paste, and all sorts
of pinched glass, lapped glass, and every other stone, glass, and
composition used in or applicable to the jewellery trade,” in ways
therein described. In 1789 an improvement in the form and construction
of “soup ladles, tureens, gravy spoons, ladles, and skimmers,” was
patented by John Baynes; and in 1790, Johanna Hempel patented newly
invented filters. In 1796, James Keeling patented improvements in
decorative and glazing processes; and in the same year, in conjunction
with Valentine Close, an improved mode of constructing “ovens, kilns,
and firing-places, so as to make and cause a very great saving of coals
and fuel in and about the firing, hardening, and baking all manner of
porcelain, china ware, and all manner of earthenwares, in every state
wherein firing is needful and necessary.”</p>

<p>In the same year, 1796, Ralph Wedgwood took out three separate patents.
The first of these was for a “new discovered and invented method of
making earthenware, whereby the article of earthenware may be made at
a less cost than hitherto, to the great advantage of the manufacturers
thereof, and of the public.” This consists “in casing over inferior
compositions with compositions commonly used for making cream-coloured
ware, white ware, or china.” “Thick bats or laminæ” of the inferior
are covered on each side with thin bats of the superior clay, and if
the edges of the ware are required to be cased, they are surrounded
“with a square piece commonly called a wad.” Afterwards the “bats”
are beat, pressed, or rolled out to the required dimensions, “as are
proper for the wares to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span> made from the same.” For moulding the wares
single moulds may be used, but double are preferred, of wood, or “wood
cased with plaster, of metal,” or any material capable of standing
much pressure. The press is such as is used for stamping buttons. The
glazing is applied dry to the bats; if the edges of the ware, after
moulding, are not properly covered with dry glaze, supply these parts
“with wet glaze, by means of a pencil;” afterwards stove and burn the
ware. The others were respectively for a new method of making glass
from old earthenware, china, &amp;c.; and for “a new-invented stove,”
“calculated principally for the use of manufacturers of earthenware and
china.” On the same day on which this patent was dated, one was also
granted to John Pepper, for a new construction of kilns or ovens for
the same purpose. In 1799 Messrs. William and John Turner patented “a
new method or methods of manufacturing porcelain or earthenware, by the
introduction of a material not heretofore used in the manufacturing of
those articles;” the material being “Tabberner’s Mine rock,” “Little
Mine rock,” and “New rock,” mixed with the growan, or Cornish stone,
and flint.</p>

<p>This is the last patent connected with ceramics before the year 1800,
and therefore brings us down to the commencement of the present
century. From 1800 to 1861 no less than three hundred and twenty-two
patents were taken out for improvements in the potter’s art or in
matters connected with that art. These will be briefly enumerated at
the close of this work, and of many of them notices will be found
incorporated in its body.</p>

<p>In the early part of this century, with the exception of the
productions of a few houses, the state of the art was still at a low
ebb; and, although improvements were constantly being made, when the
great world-struggle took place in 1851, we, as a nation, were found
to be lamentably behind some other countries, not only in the beauty
of form and decoration of our ceramic productions, but even in quality
of body and glaze. Between the Exhibitions of 1851 and 1862 a marked
improvement was effected, and this has gone on steadily extending
itself, until now Great Britain, without exception, stands foremost of
all the nations of earth in this art.</p>

<p>I now proceed, in succeeding chapters, to speak of the various
earthenware and porcelain works and seats of pottery manufacture, of
the kingdom.</p>

<p>In 1671, as I have already shown,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> John Dwight took out a patent
for “the mistery of transparent earthenware, comonly knowne by the
names of Porcelaine or China, and Persian Ware,” &amp;c. The patent runs as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p>This was the commencement of the Fulham Pottery, whose history I am
about to attempt to trace, and which has continued uninterruptedly in
work for more than two centuries.</p>

<p>Dwight appears to have been a man of considerable learning and ability.
He graduated as M.A. at Christ Church, Oxford, and successively held
the appointments of secretary to more than one Bishop of Chester. He
seems to have long experimented upon clays and mineral products in
the search after the body of which the oriental china was made, and
at length to have brought those researches to a successful issue. Six
years after the date of the first of his patents, Dr. Plot, the eminent
antiquary and keeper of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, thus wrote of
his discoveries in his “History of Oxfordshire”:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“§ 84. Amongst arts that concern <i>formation of earths</i>,
I shall not mention the making of pots at Marsh Balden and
Nuneham Courtney, nor of tobacco-pipes of the white earth of
Shotover, since those places are now deserted. Nor indeed was
there, as I ever heard of, anything extraordinary performed
during the working these <i>earths</i>, nor is there now
of a very good tobacco-pipe clay found in the parish of
Horspath, since the first printing of the third chapter of
this history.... Let it suffice for things of this nature,
that the ingenious John Dwight, formerly M.A. of Christ Church
College, Oxon, hath discovered the <i>mystery of the stone or
Cologne wares</i> (such as d’Alva bottles, jugs, noggins),
heretofore made only in Germany, and by the Dutch brought over
into England in great quantities; and hath set up a manufacture
of the same, which (by methods and contrivances of his own,
altogether unlike those used by the Germans), in three or four
years’ time, he hath brought it to greater perfection than it
has attained where it hath been used for many ages, insomuch
that the Company of Glass-sellers of London, who are the
dealers for that commodity, have contracted with the inventor
to buy only of his English manufacture, and refuse the foreign.</p>

<p>“§ 85. He hath discovered also the <i>mystery of the Hessian
wares</i>, and vessels for reteining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span> the penetrating salts and
spirits of the chymists, more serviceable than were ever made
in England, or imported from Germany itself.</p>

<p>“§ 86. And hath found ways to make an earth <i>white and
transparent as porcellane</i>, and not distinguishable frome
it by the eye, or by experiments that have been purposely made
to try wherein they disagree. To this earth he hath added the
colours that are usual in the coloured china ware, and divers
others not seen before. The skill that hath been wanting to
set up a manufacture of this <i>transparent earthenware</i> in
England, like that of China, is the glazing of the white earth,
which hath much puzzled the projector, but now that difficulty
also is in great measure overcome.</p>

<p>“§ 87. He hath also caused to be modelled <i>statues or figures
of the said transparent earth</i> (a thing not done elsewhere,
for China affords us only imperfect mouldings), which he hath
diversified with great variety of colours, making them of the
colour of iron, copper, brass, and party-colour’d as some
Achat-stones. The considerations that induced him to this
attempt were the duration of this hard-burnt earth, much above
brass or marble, against all air and weather, and the softness
of the matter to be modelled, which makes it capable of more
curious work than stones that are wrought with chisels, or
metals that are cast. In short, he has so advanced the <i>Art
Plastic</i> that ’tis dubious whether any man since Prometheus
have excelled him, not excepting the famous Damophilus and
Gorgasus of Pliny (Nat. Hist., lib. xxxv. c. 12).</p>

<p>“§ 88. And these arts he employs about meterials of English
growth, and not much applyed to other uses; for instance,
he makes the stone bottles of a clay in appearance like
to tobacco-pipe clay, which will not make tobacco-pipes,
although the tobacco-pipe clay will make bottles; so that that
which hath lain buried and useless to the owners may become
beneficial to them by reason of this manufacture, and many
working hands get good livelihoods, not to speak of the very
considerable sums of English coyn annually kept at home by it.”</p>
</div>

<p>Dwight having patented his discovery of “the mistery of transparent
earthenware, commonly known by the names of Porcelaine or China, or
Persia ware,” in April, 1671, it is perfectly clear that the discovery
must have been made before that time, and that it must have been the
result of a long series of patient trials and experiments. Thus, I
think, we may safely say that the actual discovery was made some time
prior to 1671. In 1684 the patent expired, and a new one granted, in
June, for another term of fourteen years—this time the wares and
articles being more specifically named. It is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“CHARLES THE SECOND, by the grace of God, &amp;c., to all to whom

<p>In 1694<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Houghton thus, in his “Letters on Husbandry and Trade,”
wrote<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> while speaking of the tobacco-pipe clays, “gotten at or nigh
Pool, a post-town in Dorsetshire, and there dug in square pieces, of
the bigness of about half a hundredweight each; from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span> thence ’tis
brought to London, and sold in peaceable times at about eighteen
shillings a ton, but now in this time of war is worth about three and
twenty shillings,” And again he says: “This sort of clay, as I hinted
formerly, is used to clay sugar; and the best sort of mugs are made
with it, and the ingenious Mr. <i>Daught</i> of <i>Fulham</i> tells me
that ’tis the same earth <i>China-ware</i> is made of, and ’tis made,
not by lying long in the earth, but in the fire; and if it were worth
while, we may make as good <i>China</i> here as any is in the world.
And so for this time, farewel Clay.” Again, on “March 13, 1695,” he
thus writes: “Of <i>China-ware</i> I see but little imported in the
year 1694, I presume by reason of the war and our bad luck at sea.
There came only from Spain certain, and from India certain twice.
’Tis a curious manufacture, and deserves to be encourag’d here, which
without doubt money would do; and Mr. <i>Dowoit</i> at <i>Fulham</i>
has done it, and can again in any thing that is flat: but the
difficulty is that if a hollow dish be made, it must be burnt so much
that the heat of the fire will make the sides fall. He tells me that
our clay will very well do it; the main skill is in managing the fire.
By my consent, the man that would bring it to perfection should have
for his encouragement one thousand pound from the publick, though I
help’d to pay a tax towards it.”</p>

<p>Although no specifications are preserved with Dwight’s patents,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> I
am enabled, through the extreme kindness and courtesy of the present
owner of the works, C. I. C. Bailey, Esq., to give recipes for the
manufacture of porcelain, &amp;c., in Dwight’s own words, and copied from
his own private pocket-books. These two extremely curious books were
recently discovered among some old account books and their discovery
throws considerable light on the history of the plastic art at this
period. One of these books, which is bound in vellum, contains on its
outside front cover the words:—</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
   <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">“All that is in this</div>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>but the other contains many earlier entries, from 1691. Both the books
are in Dwight’s own handwriting. Among the number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span> curious recipes
are the following, which possess more than ordinary interest.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These extracts will be amply sufficient to show the interest and
importance of these curious old books which have so kindly been placed
at my disposal for this work by their owner, Mr. Bailey, but I cannot
refrain from giving some extracts of a totally different character.
These relate to the way Mr. Dwight had of being his own banker by
hiding his money in all sorts of out-of-the-way corners of his
pot-works until wanted. Probably there may still be some of <i>this</i>
“treasure-trove,” as well as his moulds and models, &amp;c., to be turned
on by some fortunate possessor of the place.</p>

at by adding the figures together as they occur in form of a cross, 1,
2, 8, and 4.</p>

“Deb Nel,” “Miss Betty Osgood,” “Miss Lucy,” “Miss Betty Osgood,” and

<p>Dwight is stated to have buried, in like manner as he did his money,
all his models, tools, moulds, &amp;c., in some still-unknown secret
hiding-place of his manufactory that his descendants might not continue
that branch of the trade which he had been the first to invent; and
very securely he has, evidently, done this; for, whatever may be found
in future alterations and excavations, it is certain that these have
never yet been brought to light. A few years ago, however, after taking
down some of the old buildings, which had become much dilapidated,
the workmen, while digging foundations for the new workshops, &amp;c.,
discovered a vaulted chamber or cellar which had been firmly walled
up, and which, on being broken into, was found to contain a number of
stoneware grey-beards or bellarmines and ale-pots, &amp;c., undoubtedly
of Dwight’s manufacture. These were of the same form, precisely, as
the old Cologne ones which they were intended to, and did, supersede
in this country—and were those “fine stone gorges never before made
in England”—and for which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span> his patent was granted. One of these,
presented to me by the present proprietor of the works, Mr. Bailey, I
here engrave (Fig. <a href="#image128">338</a>).</p>

<p>Nothing, at present, is known as to when the death of John Dwight took
place, or who succeeded him. A Dr. Dwight died at Fulham in 1737,
who, according to the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> of that year, was
“author of several curious treatises on physic. He was the first that
found out the secret to colour earthenware like china;” but this was
not John Dwight, as supposed by some writers, but Samuel Dwight, who,
in 1722, published “De Vomitione, et Purgatione, eorumque excessu
curando, necnon de emiticis Medicamentis, de Catharticis, et Variolis,
et Morbillis;” in 1725, “De Hydropibus;” and in 1731, “De Febribus,
Symptomaticis.” As the death of this Samuel Dwight took place in
1737, or sixty-six years after the date of John Dwight’s patent, the
probability is that he was the son of John Dwight, and that his finding
out the secret of colouring earthenware like china took place while
engaged in his father’s business. About this time it would appear
(probably after the death of Samuel Dwight) the business was carried
on by a Margaret Dwight, in partnership with Thomas Warland, and these
two—Margaret Dwight and Thomas Warland of Fulham, potters—became
bankrupt in 1746. This lady is said afterwards to have married a Mr.
White, or Wight, who continued the works. In 1762 “William White, of
Fulham, in the county of Middlesex, potter,” took out a patent for
the manufacture of “white crucibles or melting potts made of British
materials, and never before made in England or elsewhere, and which
I have lately sett up at Fulham aforesaid,” and which were composed
of “Stourbridge clay and Dorsetshire clay, calcined; mix them with
Woolwich sand and water, to be trodden with the feet, and then
burned.” For these he had, in the previous year, obtained a premium
from the Society of Arts. In 1795 the works were, according to Lysons,
“carried on by Mr. White, a descendant in the female line of the first
proprietor,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span> and they were so continued until 1862, when, on the death
of the then Mr. White, they passed into the hands of Messrs. Makintosh
and Clements. Two years later, however, on the death of Mr. Makintosh,
the works were sold to the present proprietor, Mr. C. I. C. Bailey,
who shortly afterwards considerably enlarged and improved them; he
having built a new factory and introduced the newest and most improved
machinery.</p>

<p>The articles and the wares made by the Dwights will have been pretty
well understood from the foregoing notice; but, in addition, it is
essential to speak of some few well-authenticated examples which still
exist. About the time of the sale in 1862, Mr. Baylis, of Priors
Bank, obtained from the Fulham works a number—about twenty-five—of
extremely curious and historically valuable specimens of the ware
produced there by the Dwights, and kept in the family. Of these he sent
a brief account to the <i>Art-Journal</i>,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> a part of which I here
transcribe:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The first is a dish, said, and with more than mere
probability, to be one of a dinner set manufactured for the
especial service of Charles II. It is of a round form and large
size, being 64½ inches in circumference. The groundwork is a
rich blue, approaching to the ultramarine; it is surrounded
by a broad rim nearly four inches wide, formed by a graceful
border of foliage and birds in white, and shaded with pale
blue. The whole of the centre is occupied by the royal arms,
surmounted by its kingly helmet, crown and lion crest. The
arms themselves are encircled with the garter, on which is
inscribed the well-known motto, ‘<i>Honi soit qui mal y
pense</i>.’ The arms and supporters rest upon a groundwork
of foliage, in the middle of which is the motto, ‘<i>Dieu et
mon Droit</i>.’ The workmanship of this piece of crockery
is of very superior character, and a dinner set of similar
ware would make many a modern one look poor. The solitary
specimen left of this once-magnificent royal dinner service
<i>is believed to be by far the finest extant of this early
English manufacture</i>, and includes five classical figures
of brown ware, of admirable execution, testifying to the skill
and taste of the Italian workmen: they consist of Saturn—at
least we presume it is meant for him, as he is represented
with a child in his arms, which he seems to be on the point of
devouring, according to his agreement with his brother Titan.
He has already got the child’s hand in his mouth, and the
bite of his teeth is by no means agreeable to his offspring,
as is evident by the expression of pain on his countenance.
The next figure is Jupiter, the third is Neptune, the fourth
Mars, and the fifth either Adonis or Meleager, the emblem of
the boar’s head applying to either—the former being killed
by a boar; the latter having killed the boar; and as the
head is cut off, and lying at his feet, it is most probably
Meleager, as he cut off the head of the beast and presented it
to Atalanta. The grey ware consists of a bust of Charles II.;
a bust of his queen, Catherine of Braganza; another of James
II., and a companion one of his queen, Mary d’Este—all four of
meritorious execution and excellent likenesses; a statuette of
Flora; a likeness of one of the Dwight family, thirteen inches
high; another of Adonis, same height; and a likeness of a lady;
a portrait of one of the Dwights; a smaller pair of statuettes
of a gentleman and lady of the court of Charles II., probably
intended as likenesses; a curious figure, or rather bust, of
one sleeping, or rather lying on a pillow, for it was a death
likeness, and is inscribed ‘Lydia Dwight, dyd March the 3rd,
1762;’ a drinking cup, called Hogarth’s cup—it is lettered
‘Midnight Conversation,’ and and has on it a representation of
Hogarth’s picture in raised figures, and also four arms of the
City companies. There are also four brown liqueur bottles, with
white figures in relief, <i>temp.</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span> Charles II., with his
initial letter; and one or two specimens, such as a butter-boat
and a couple of pickle saucers of fine grey ware; but these
appear of a somewhat different kind of manufacture, and may
have been brought from Delft.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Other productions were flip-cans, gorges, grey beards, ale pots,
bottles, mugs, single figures and groups, busts, statuettes, flasks,
leaf-dishes, &amp;c. In the Jermyn Street Museum are some examples of this
ware, and others may be found in various private collections. Among the
latter may be named an historically interesting flip-can, belonging to
“Robinson Crusoe,” and carefully preserved by his family. It bears the
incised inscription—</p>

<p>The goods now made at these works, by Mr. Bailey, are glazed and
unglazed stoneware, porous ware, terra-cotta, and china. In stoneware,
or “Bristol ware,” all the usual domestic vessels—in bottles,
pitchers, jars, pans, drinking-mugs, tobacco-pots, feet, carriage, and
chest warmers, funnels, bird fountains, barrels, filters, &amp;c.—are made
very extensively, as also are drain and sanitary pipes, traps, &amp;c., of
every description. The stoneware is of the hardest, finest, and most
durable character, and the glaze is remarkably good. To this excellent
quality is to be attributed the success of these works, Mr. Bailey
supplying, I believe, the large house of Crosse &amp; Blackwell, as well
as many distillers, chemists, and shippers, with their stoneware, both
for home and export trade, and constantly increasing his business and
premises. Works of art of a high order, in his stoneware, terra cotta,
china, and other productions, are now executed. For the stoneware
department, M. Cazin, late Director of the School of Art at Tours, in
France, has been engaged chiefly to design figured and other fancy
jugs, mugs, cannettes, &amp;c. Some of these, with armorial bearings and
other decorations in incised lines, or impressed, are remarkably good
adaptations of the antique. A cannette, in my own possession, bearing
the artist’s name, “<span class="allsmcap">CAZIN, 1872, STUDY</span>,” is remarkably good,
and gives evidence of great things to follow. Another example, also
in my own possession, and made expressly for me, is of excellent form
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span> remarkably pure and simple design. It bears an admirably modelled
armorial medallion, with arms, crests, helmet, mantling, &amp;c., and is
likewise decorated with incised and relief ornaments. On the bottom is
the date, incised, “1873,” and on the handle the artist’s name, <span class="allsmcap">C.
CAZIN</span>, also incised. In 1872 Mr. Bailey received a medal at the
Dublin Exhibition for his stoneware and terra cotta.</p>

<p>Mr. Bailey has introduced a marked improvement in the construction of
filters—the water passing downwards at the back, and then rising in
zig-zag direction by its own force to the tap at the top in front—thus
the water has to travel a much further distance through the filtering
matter (as shown by the arrows in the section) than the old method, and
having to be taken a far more circuitous course, it is brought more
thoroughly in contact with the purifying medium. The usual method is
for the water to pass perpendicularly down or up, but in these filters
the water is kept a considerable time in contact with the charcoal and
other ingredients, and any sediment is left at the bottom, instead of
forming a compact mass of filth for the water to pass through each time
it is filled.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image131">

     <p class="p0 center sm">Fig. 339.</p>
  </div>

<p>Terra-cotta stoves, of simple and effective construction, are also
extensively made at these works. In “Sunderland Ware”—<i>i.e.</i>
brown ware, white inside—cream pots, starch pans, milk bowls, dishes,
trays, and basins are largely manufactured.</p>

<p>Chemical apparatus—receivers, retorts, evaporating dishes, condensing
worms, filtering and other funnels, still heads, &amp;c.,—are a speciality
in these works, and are of high repute.</p>

<p>These various goods were thus spoken of in the Official Report of the
International Exhibition, 1871:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Bailey exhibits some samples of well-made chemical ware of
a highly vitreous and durable body, consisting of acid tanks,
retorts, receivers, condensing worms, and other vessels. He
sends one or two specimens of sewer pipes, well burnt, and of
dense body. His contribution of Bristol ware, for excellence
of make, glaze, and colour, is equal to any exhibited, and
comprises, among many other things, an ingenious ascension
filter, in which, by a certain arrangement of stoneware
discs in the interior, the water is more exposed to the
filtering material than in ordinary filters. A churn, entirely
constructed of stoneware, by this exhibitor, is also well worth
notice; it is stated to be exceedingly rapid in its action.”</p>
</div>

<p>In terra-cotta, the Fulham Works now produce vases, statues,
architectural enrichments, chimney shafts, stoves, &amp;c., of very good
quality and of admirable design; Mr. R. W. Martin, sculptor, student of
the Royal Academy and Government Schools of Art,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span> having been engaged
as modeller and designer. The productions in this department are of a
very high order of merit, and will take rank with those of any other
manufactory. The brackets and jardinières are of great beauty, and are
characterised by a pure artistic feeling and a touch such as is seldom
attained; the pieces bear evidence of being not only modelled by a
clever artist, but of receiving finishing-touches by the master-hand
itself. In colour the Fulham terra cotta is a light pink and a rich
red, and, when these are combined, a peculiar delicacy and finished
effect is produced. The mark <span class="smcap">R. W. Martin</span> <i>fecit</i> occurs
on the productions of this artist.</p>

<p>The manufacture of china ware was, during the year 1873, very wisely
and successfully added to this establishment, and, with the aid of the
good workmen and artists who have been engaged, has already done much
to establish a fresh fame for Fulham. The art direction of this branch
was placed by Mr. Bailey in the hands of Mr. E. Bennet, a well-known
sculptor, while the china body flowers, &amp;c., were undertaken by Mr.
Hopkinson. I am the more particular in stating these arrangements as,
being the beginning of a new manufacture, I am desirous of putting on
record the circumstances of its commencement. The “body,” it may be
well to note, is made from Dwight’s original recipe—the very body of
which the first china ware made in England was produced—and therefore
the “Fulham china” of to-day has an historical interest attached to it
which is possessed by no other. It was a wise thought that induced Mr.
Bailey to restore to Fulham the special manufacture which has rendered
its name famous in the ceramic annals of this country; and it is to
be hoped that the spirit he has shown will be amply compensated by a
liberal patronage of his productions.</p>

<p>The marks used by Mr. Bailey are:—</p>

<p>At the 1871 Exhibition (at which no medals were given) Mr. Bailey’s
productions were highly spoken of in the Official Report; and at the
Dublin Exhibition of 1872 he was awarded a medal for his terra cotta
and stoneware.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Lambeth.</h3>

<p>Lambeth has been a seat of pottery manufacture from an early period. In
mediæval times the characteristic brown-ware pitchers, pans, tygs, &amp;c.,
were made; and, later on, at this place was quite a colony of makers
of Delft ware, who in turn gave place to stoneware manufacturers.
China, too, appears to have been made at Lambeth from perhaps 1760,
or thereabouts. It is recorded that in the middle of the seventeenth
century the Delft ware manufacture commenced; but it is not unlikely
that Rous and Cullyn, some years earlier, here established themselves
in the making of “stone potts, stone jugs, and stone bottels,” for
which they received a patent in 1626.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> It is conjectured, and with
some probability, that one of the Delft ware makers at this place was
John Ariens Van Hamme, a Dutchman, who had come over from the Hague
under the encouragement of our ambassador, who, as has already been
shown,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> took out a patent in 1676 for the “art of makeinge tiles and
porcelane and other earthen wares, after the way practiced in Holland,”
and who, with his staff of workmen, probably formed the nucleus of what
was afterwards a nest of potters, comprising, according to the “History
of Lambeth,” no less than twenty manufactories. In 1693 a trial took
place in the Court of Exchequer concerning some parcels of potter’s
clay which had been seized by the Custom House officers, under pretence
that it was fuller’s earth. In this trial five London potters, William
Knight, Thomas Harper, Henry De Wilde, John Robins, and Moses Johnson,
gave evidence in favour of the clay being potter’s clay. There is
nothing in the record of this trial to identify any of the five potters
therein named with Lambeth; but the probability is that some of them
belonged to that place. One of them, William Knight, was undoubtedly
the “William Knight of the parish of St. Buttolph Without, Aldgate,
London, Pottmaker,” concerning whom I give, from the original deed in
my possession, some particulars under the head of “Aldgate;” some of
the others were, I believe, of Lambeth. The account of the trial has
been printed by my friend, Mr. Reeks, in the “Catalogue of the Museum
of Practical Geology,” and is so interesting that I here reproduce it
entire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent"><i>A Brief Account of the Evidence given on behalf of</i>
Edmund Warner, <i>at a</i> Tryal <i>had at the Bar the 24th
of</i> November, 1693, <i>before the Four Barons of the</i>
Exchequer, <i>relating to a Parcel of</i> Potters Clay,
<i>seized by the</i> Custom-House <i>Officers, under the
pretence of it’s being</i> Fullers Earth.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>William Riddal</i> swore that he was Steward and Tenant
to the said <i>Warner</i> for above 20 Years, in all which
time the said <i>Warner</i> constantly sold to the Potters
in <i>London</i> considerable quantities of the same sort
of clay now in dispute, for the making of White and Painted
Earthen-Ware: That he never knew or heard that the least Parcel
of it was ever sold as Fullers-Earth, or put to any other Use
than making Earthen-Ware, excepting some small quantities
yearly in the Neighbourhood for daubing of Houses, which may
be alledged as a good Argument that the said Clay is not of
the nature of Fullers-Earth; for, whereas this makes the best
Clay Wall in <i>England</i>, if it were of the nature of
Fullers-Earth, upon the first wet Weather it would all fall to
the Ground: He likewise further deposed, That the first time
the said <i>Warner</i> shipt the said Clay for <i>Holland</i>,
it was seized by the <i>Custom-house</i> Officers as
Fullers-Earth; but upon Tryal of it, they were convinced of
their Error, and cleared the same.</p>

<p><i>William Knight</i>, <i>Thomas Harper</i>, <i>Henry de
Wilde</i>, <i>John Robins</i>, <i>Moses Johnson</i> are all
Potters in <i>London</i>, and swore that they had all seen the
said <i>Warner’s</i> Clay, which was seized, that it was really
Potter’s Clay, and of the same sort which they had constantly
bought of him, some for above 25 Years, others ever since they
were Traders, that it is of a quite different nature from
Fullers Earth; for the said <i>Warner’s</i> Clay tho’ never so
often dissolved in Water, may be brought into a Body again,
and will work, like Wax, into any shape, whereas Fullers Earth
being once dissolved is never to be got into any Body, but when
it is dry crumbles like Sand, and all the art of Man can never
make a Pot of it.</p>

<p><i>Hen. de Wilde</i>, one of the said Potters, farther
deposed, That about five Years since he shipt some of the said
<i>Warner’s</i> Clay for <i>Pensilvania</i>, where his Son had
set up a Pot-House, that the Custom-House Officers did then
likewise seize it as Fullers-Earth, but upon Trial of it found
they were mistaken, and cleared the same.</p>

<p><i>Benjamin Furly</i>, Merchant in <i>Rotterdam</i>, to whom
the said <i>Warner</i> consigned his Clay, <i>John Sonman</i>,
Servant to the said <i>Furly</i>, were, by virtue of a
Commission from the Court of <i>Exchequer</i>, examined upon
Oath (by Commissioners appointed for that purpose), to several
Interrogatories, and their Depositions being read in Court,
did plainly prove that all the said <i>Warner’s</i> Clay which
was sent for <i>Holland</i> was really sold to Potters for
making of Earthen-Ware; That they never heard, nor do believe
that any part of it was ever used for the Fulling Trade, or is
any way proper for it; that they sold the said <i>Warner’s</i>
Clay from 25 to 30 Guilders a Last, when they could buy
Fullers-Earth at 7 Guilders a Last.</p>

<p><i>Adrian Van Arde</i>, sworn Measurer of all the Earth and
Clay imported to <i>Rotterdam</i>, was examined by vertue of
the said Commission, and Deposed, That for many Years which
he had been in that Office, he never knew or heard of any
<i>English</i> Fullers-Earth imported into <i>Holland</i>, that
they were so plentifully supplied with that sort of Earth from
<i>Flanders</i>; that it is commonly bought and sold at Seven
Guilders a Last, and had an Hundred Last by him to sell at the
same Rate.</p>

<p>Ten or Twelve Potters in <i>Holland</i> were likewise examined
by virtue of the said Commission, and deposed severally,
That they had bought considerable quantities of the said
<i>Warner’s</i> clay of Mr. <i>Benj. Furly</i>, and paid for
the same from 25 to 30 Guilders a Last; that they used the same
in making Earthen-Ware, but do not believe it any way useful
for the Fulling Trade, nor never heard that any of it was ever
sold for that use.</p>

<p>Colonel <i>Holt</i>, a Member of Parliament, swore, That he
(being very lately in <i>Holland</i>) made the strictest
inquiries into the Truth of this Business, that he could, First
amongst the Potters, who all declared to the same Effect, as
in their Depositions before mentioned, that he likewise took
some of the said <i>Warner’s</i> Clay, and got a Fuller to
try it, whether it were any way useful for their Trade, who
answered it was not? nor could he use it if he might have it
for Nothing; after which the Colonel ask’d him, From whence
they were supplied with Fullers-Earth, and at what Rates? The
Fullers answered, generally from <i>Flanders</i> at 6½, and 7
Guilders <i>per</i> Last; and sometimes from <i>Rosendale</i>,
in the <i>States</i> Dominions, at 10 Guilders <i>per</i> Last;
that being much dryer, and wasted less by lying; all which the
Colonel (being unwilling to believe upon the Fuller’s bare
word) caused to be drawn up in the Form of an Affidavit, and
the Fuller before a Magistrate, swore to the Truth of it, which
Affidavit the Colonel hath to produce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <i>Edward Paget</i>, a Divine, swore, That he being in
<i>Holland</i> at the same time, made the like Enquiry amongst
the Fullers at <i>Layden</i>, the chief cloathing Town in
<i>Holland</i>, who all gave him the same Information, that the
Fuller at Rotterdam had done the Colonel above; and for his
better satisfaction, Three of the Chiefest went with him before
a Magistrate, and swore to the Truth of what they Affirmed;
after which he went to <i>Delft</i> amongst the Potters, who
all affirmed the same thing, that the Ten or Twelve had sworn
in their aforementioned Depositions, the Truth of which they
attested by a Certificate, under the Hands of above Twenty,
which Affidavits, and Certificate, the said <i>Paget</i> hath
to produce.</p>

<p><i>Rich. Cutler</i>, <i>Matthew Hanson</i>, Ship-brokers,
swore, They had hired many Ships for the said <i>Warner</i>,
to load Clay for <i>Rotterdam</i>; and the general Price of
the Fraight, and Primage paid for the same, was 15 Guilders, 8
Stivers <i>per</i> Last; and sometimes 17 Guilders, 12 Stivers
<i>per</i> Last.</p>

<p><i>Will. Read</i>, <i>Tho. Wood</i>, <i>John Saliby</i>,
Mariners, swore, They had the same Prices above mentioned, for
several Fraights which they carried, and saw delivered to the
Potters in <i>Holland</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hump. Bellomy</i>, <i>Richard Hopkins</i>, <i>Timothy
Fowler</i>, <i>—— Shepherd</i>, Worcester, are all Buyers,
and Sellers of Fullers-Earth, and swore they could well judge
of the same, having dealt therein from Ten to above Twenty-five
Years, that they all took Samples of the said <i>Warner’s</i>
Clay, out of the King’s Celler, and tryed all the Experiments
to judge of it, that they were capable of; and possitively
affirmed that it was no Fullers-Earth; neither could they find
anything of the Nature of Fullers-Earth in it, that for their
Use they would not give a Shilling for 100 Last, for they
should never be able to sell it.</p>

<p>Alderman <i>Bearcraft</i>, <i>Tho. Cooksey</i>, <i>John
Wynn</i>, <i>Rowl. Hancock</i>, <i>Gloucestershire</i>;
<i>Rich. Osborne</i>, <i>Tho. Woorrel</i>, <i>John Chilton</i>,
<i>Sam. Beadle</i>, <i>Essex</i>; <i>Simon Meazy</i>, <i>John
Lawson</i>, <i>John Backer</i>, <i>John Peartree</i>,

Baines</i>, <i>John Smith</i>, <i>John Carter</i>, <i>Dan.
Wenden</i>, <i>Sam. Wrinch</i>, <i>London</i>; <i>Dan.
Barrs</i>, <i>John St. Berry</i>, are all Clothiers, Fullers,
and Cloth-Workers; being the most eminent in their several
Places; as well for Honesty, as great Traders, and good
Estates; they all swore they had made the most impartial
Experiments they could of the said <i>Warner’s</i> Clay, now
in dispute, being the same taken out of the King’s Celler,
that they tried it upon several sorts of Goods, as several
sorts of <i>Cloth</i>, <i>Bays</i>, <i>Cloth-Serges</i>, and
<i>Perpetuanæs</i>, and every one possitively affirmed that
it was no Fuller’s-Earth, but on the contrary was an absolute
Enemy to the Woollen Manufacture; for instead of scouring,
it fix’d the Grease in the Grownd of all the Goods, that
were done with it, and instead of makeing them White, it
absolutely stained them Yellow, all which was apparent to the
most common Eye, in all the above-said several sorts of Goods,
produced in Court: They likewise declared upon Oath, that they
were all Strangers to the said <i>Warner</i>; and that it
was as prejudicial to their interest, to have Fullers-Earth
Transported, as any men’s, and therefore could have no
Inducement to favour the said <i>Warner</i>, beyond the Merits
of his cause, to the Violation of their Consciences.</p>

<p><i>This is so just a Recital of the Evidence given on behalf
of the said Warner, that he challenges the greatest of his
Enemies to detect him of the least Falsehood therein; and
if his Adversaries had been as fair in representing theirs,
there would have been no need of this; for whereas in their
printed Papers they make their Witnesses to affirm the
said</i> Warner’s <i>clay was tried in all Experiments,
without any mixture, there was not above One or Two, but upon
cross-Examination at the Tryal, owned they used either Segg and
Hogs dung, or Soap and Gauls with it, which would have scowered
any Cloath better without the said Clay than with it.</i></p>

<p><i>It may not be amiss likewise to observe that for a whole
Year in which the</i> Custom-House <i>Officers have been so
very diligent in spreading the Fame of the said</i> Warner’s
<i>Clay to be the best</i> Fullers-Earth <i>in</i> England,
<i>he hath not been able to sell the least quantity of it as
such, tho’ he has proffered it to all Men for a very little
more than one-Third of what Fullers-Earth is generally sold
for.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Delft ware here made was of the ordinary kind, same as imported
from Holland, and as that made in various English localities, and,
being without mark, is not to be distinguished from others. Besides
tiles, plates, jugs, mugs, dishes, &amp;c., sack and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span> wine bottles,
apothecaries’ pill-slabs, wine-bin labels, &amp;c., were made. Some of
these pill-slabs are preserved in the Jermyn Street Museum, as are also
some of the “sack-pots,” both of which may most probably, as well as
the apothecaries’ jars, be ascribed to Lambeth. They are all of Delft
ware, painted with blue, in the same manner as the tiles and other
articles of this ware.</p>

<p>In 1820 there “were six or seven potters in Lambeth,” says Mr. Goddard,
“working some sixteen small kilns, of seven or eight feet in diameter,
the produce of each kiln being under £20 worth of ware, the principal
articles made being blacking bottles, ginger-beer bottles (very
extensively made still), porter and cider bottles (not so largely made
now), spruce-beer bottles (gone, with the beer, quite out of fashion),
ink bottles (more used now than ever), oil bottles, pickle jars,
hunting jugs, &amp;c. A few chemical vessels were also turned out well from
one kiln belonging to an eccentric individual, whose chief boast was to
drink a gallon of beer a day, and do without rest on Sundays.” In 1860:
“In place of some sixteen kilns, turning out each under £20 per kiln,
we have now about seventy, turning out each, perhaps, on an average
£50. They consume upwards of 20,000 tons of coal, paying a corporation
tax of say £2,100 per annum. The law requires this quantity to be burnt
without smoke, and, after immense cost and labour, this difficulty may
be called surmounted. Twenty-three thousand tons of clay are annually
changed into useful articles, giving employment to more than eight
hundred persons. The returns of the Lambeth potters cannot be estimated
at less than £140,000.”</p>

<p><i>High Street.</i>—From about 1750 to 1770 the Delft ware works
were carried on by a Mr. Griffiths, who had, for those days, a large
establishment. A curious reference to this manufactory occurs in the
following extract from the <i>Monthly Magazine</i> for 1797. A man,
at that time unknown, but who turned out to be James Doe, a potter,
committed suicide by drowning, on the 14th of September in that year,
at Sea Mill Docks, two and a half miles from Bristol, having remained
“fasting and praying,” without food or bedding in the ruined building
there from the 11th, waiting opportunity and determination to commit
the rash act; and having, during the whole of that time, written a
kind of diary of his feelings and intentions, his hopes and fears, on
the walls of the old room he remained in. Mr. Joseph James interested
himself much in the matter, and wrote an account for the <i>Monthly
Magazine</i>; and this, and the inquest, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span> other means he took,
resulted in the discovery of the name and some particulars of the
life of the suicide. Two of the letters forwarded in October, 1797,
are highly interesting as showing at what works he had been employed.
The first letter is from London, from “a respectable proprietor of a
pottery there,” and thus runs:—</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center p1">“<i>To the Editor of the</i> <span class="smcap">Monthly Magazine</span>.</p>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>“The extraordinary and affecting manuscript writing of the
unfortunate stranger found drowned in Sea-Mill Dock, which I
transmitted to you last month, having very probably excited
the attention and sympathy of many of your numerous readers, I
feel it a duty incumbent upon me to lay before them (through
the channel of your useful publication) some information which
I have since been enabled to procure of this unhappy and
extraordinary person.</p>

<p>“A few days previous to the publication of your magazine,
I caused a paragraph to be again inserted in the Bristol
newspapers, requesting the attention of the readers to the
personal description of the stranger found drowned at Sea-Mill
Dock, and inviting the two women who had made inquiries after a
stranger that was missing, and answering the same description,
to come forward with their information, as the only probable
means left of tracing out the name and connections of this
unfortunate stranger. I was soon after waited on by two
gentlemen of Bristol of the name of Ring, the proprietors of a
large pottery, whose information and description of a person
lately come to Bristol, and who worked in their manufactory,
in the art of painting china, so exactly corresponded with the
clothing and person of the man found drowned at Sea-Mills, that
there remained not a doubt of his being the person, the subject
of their inquiry. Through their polite assistance I obtained
the name of the deceased, which is James Doe, and I also
got an interview with the K—f—m acquaintance, who, having
visited the tenement, and viewed the manuscript writing there
upon the wall, recognised the handwriting of his friend; he
gave me likewise a description of his person and dress, which
corresponded with that already published. For particulars of
the deceased’s family and friends, I was referred to several
persons in London, one of whom, a respectable proprietor of a
pottery there, writes thus:—</p>

<p class="p1">“‘<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—I received yours, and was much
affected at its contents. I should have written sooner,
but I wished first to see his uncle, who has informed
me of the following particulars:—</p>

<p>“‘James Doe was born at Lambeth, in Surrey, of very
respectable parents, and was educated in the same
place. He served an apprenticeship at Lambeth to a
painter in the china and earthenware line, and he
painted in the biscuit before it was glazed. In this
line he was esteemed a good workman; and, to my own
knowledge, he worked some years at Mr. Wedgwood’s
manufactory in Staffordshire. He was there very much
respected by his employer, his fellow-workmen, and
by all who knew him. He was fond of company, but I
do not remember him to neglect business when urgent.
Having a tolerably good education, he was fond of
reading. He was particularly generous, and always
first to relieve any of the trade out of employ or in
sickness. He worked at Mr. Baddely’s, in Staffordshire,
for six or seven years, and was, at that place,
very much respected. In fact, I believe him to be
generally beloved and respected wheresoever he worked.
About three years ago he came to London, and finding
little or no employment in the line in which he was
brought up, he was obliged to leave town, and, being
assisted by his friends, he embarked on board a ship
for Newcastle, and from thence went on to Glasgow in
Scotland, where he was a fellow-workman with one of
my present journeymen, and supported an excellent
character there. From this time, I believe, he met
with many disappointments. He then went to Ireland,
and, after stopping there a short time, he embarked
on board a vessel bound for Swansea, in South Wales,
where he worked some time, and then went on to the
Worcestershire China Manufactory, which was, I believe,
the last place he worked at.’”</p>
</div>

<p>The following is an extract from the letter alluded to:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="r2">“‘<span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>Nov. 20, 1797</i>.</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—</p>

<p>“‘You seem to be very anxious concerning the life of the
unfortunate stranger found drowned in Sea-Mill Dock. You have
a right to know it, for the kindness you have shown to his
unfortunate remains. James Doe was born at Lambeth, about two
miles from London, of honest parents, who brought him up in
as creditable a manner as their circumstances would admit. At
the age of fourteen years, or thereabouts, he was put as an
apprentice to Mr. Griffiths, at the delft pottery, High Street,
Lambeth. When he was out of his time, he continued working
at his business until he became slack; and the queen’s ware
meeting with great encouragement, he went into Staffordshire
for employment, where he remained upwards of twenty years,
working for different masters, and then came up to London, in
want of employ, and got work at China-gilding for a few months.
He was then invited into Staffordshire again, where he remained
but a short time: and from that time he has been considered
the wanderer of the trade. He was the most charitable man I
ever knew; and he was often known to neglect himself when
misfortunes came on his friends and acquaintances, to whose
relief he contributed both time and money, as much as lay in
his power. Believe me, Sir, you have bestowed your trouble
on the remains of a very good-hearted man. The acquaintance
he alluded to in his diary, and another person, were going
to France, about thirteen years ago, with a view of carrying
over and establishing there the queen’s-ware manufactory; some
of the master potters heard of it, and had them confined in
prison. As soon as James Doe heard of it, he went through the
trade to gather money to support his friend, and to preserve
him from want; and he, poor soul, contributed all he had, for
that purpose. To be denied assistance by that man whom he had
relieved in distress, was too great for his tender heart to
bear. Sir, I do not pretend to hold my friend up to perfection,
the last action of his life is against him; but, I believe, the
denial of relief by that man whom he had served and relieved in
distress was the sole cause of his committing the rash act of
suicide. The language of the manuscript writing is nearly the
same as his last conversation with me, as far as this friend
is mentioned. I perfectly agree with you, that he was in his
senses as much as he ever was in his life, when he committed
the act of suicide. He was acquainted with a Mr. Greenwood
in Staffordshire for some years, a man remarkable for fine
knowledge; to that man the unfortunate Doe owed a great deal of
his knowledge; and although Mr. Greenwood was a very sensible
man, yet he held it just for a man to destroy himself, and,
like my friend, in his perfect senses, actually made away with
himself the day before he was to have been married to a person
of credit and property. They are two of the strangest suicides
I ever heard; and had James Doe written to his friends in
London, he would have had money sent him; for his friends in
London would have thought it a happiness to relieve him. He was
a very useful man in the Staffordshire ware manufactory, as
he had studied the chemical secrets of that business. He was
fond of reading. I shall be happy to communicate any further
particulars you may require; and am, Sir,</p>

<p class="r2">“‘Yours,’ &amp;c. &amp;c.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the possession of Mr. R. C. Ring is a mug painted by Doe—said
to be his last work. It is signed “J. Doe, Sept., 1797;” and as he
committed suicide on the 14th of that month, it would certainly be one
of his last productions. Mr. Owen’s assertion that he committed suicide
through a fear that that painting would injure the enameller’s trade
is, from the above letters, &amp;c., amply shown to be without foundation.</p>

<p><i>Coades.</i>—Coade’s Artificial Stone Works, at Pedlar’s Acre,
King’s Arms Stairs, Narrow Wall, Lambeth, opposite Whitehall Stairs or
Ferry, were established about 1760 by Mrs. or the Misses Coade, under
the name of “Coade’s Lithodipyra, Terra Cotta, or Artificial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span> Stone
Manufactory.” This material was intended to take the place of carved
stone for vases, statues, and architectural enrichments. In 1769 the
two Misses Coade took into partnership their cousin, a Mr. Sealy (the
nephew of Mr. Coade), and by these the works were carried on. In 1811
the firm was still “Coades &amp; Sealy.” At the death of Mr. Sealy, who
survived the Misses Coade, a Mr. Croggan, who had for a long time been
a clerk or manager attached to the business, became the proprietor
of the works, which he continued for many years. He then disposed
of the business to Messrs. Routledge, Greenwood, &amp; Keene, who were
succeeded by Messrs. Routledge &amp; Lucas. These gentlemen, about 1840,
dissolved partnership and sold off all their moulds, models, plant,
&amp;c., by auction, by Messrs. Rushworth &amp; Jarvis, of Saville Row. Many
of these moulds and models were bought by Mr. Blashfield<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and by
other manufacturers, among whom was Mr. H. M. Blanchard of Blackfriars
Road<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> (which see), and who, being an apprentice with the Coades, and
possessing many of their models, &amp;c., claims to be their successor.</p>

<p>The Coades are said to have come from Lyme Regis, in Dorsetshire, and
probably it was for the purpose of turning their native clay to good
account in London that induced them to establish this manufactory.
Bacon, Flaxman, Banks, Rossi, and Panzetta, the sculptors, were
employed to model for these works, and many of the old mansions
and public buildings in London and in the country, as well as
abroad—including the bas-relief in the pediment over the western
portico of Greenwich Hospital, representing the death of Nelson,
designed by Benjamin West, and modelled by Bacon and Panzetta; and the
rood-screen of St. George’s Chapel, Windsor; the statue of Britannia
on the Nelson monument at Yarmouth, &amp;c.—were executed at these works.
The works principally produced at Coades were capitals of columns,
statues, vases, bassi-relievi, monuments, coats of arms, keystones,
angle rusticated blocks, balustrades, &amp;c. They were of durable quality
and excellent manufacture.</p>

<p>Another person employed at Coades was William John Coffee, who
afterwards attained some celebrity as a modeller at the Derby China
Works, and as a terra cotta maker, for a short time, at Derby. I
believe he was employed as a fire-man at Coades, and here, no doubt,
being a clever fellow, picked up his knowledge of modelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span> and of
mixing bodies. The following curious letter and “information,” from
the originals in my own possession, give some highly interesting
particulars regarding Coades’ and Sealy’s manufactory in 1790:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>The information got from the fire-man that worked at the
Artificial Stone Manufactory, Lambeth</i>:—There is three
kilns, the largest is 9 feet diameter and about 10 feet high,
the other two are sizes under; they have only three fire-holes
to each, and they are about 14 inches in the clear. They make
use of no saggers, but their kilns are all muffled about two
inches thick, which was always done by this fire-man. They
always was four days and four nights of fireing a kilns, and
the moment the goods are fire’d up he always took and stop’d
the kilns intirely close from any air whatever without lowering
the fires at all. He has been use to fire intirely with coal
(which are call’d Hartley coals—they are not much unlike yours
at Derby). He never made use of any thermometer, but depended
intirely on his own knowledge. The composition shrinks about
half an inch in a foot in the drying, and about the same in the
firing. A great deal of the ornaments are 4 inches thick when
fired, and he has fired figures 9 feet high. This man has had
the intire management of building the kilns, setting and firing
them for many years; his wages was one guinea per week, and
for every night when he fired he had 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for
the small kiln, 3<i>s.</i> for the next size, and 3<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> for the largest.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—Quite unexpected, the fire-man from Lambeth
that I have been after so long, call’d on me on Monday, to say
that he was out of imploy; therefore I engaged him to meet me
at Field’s in the evening, which he did; and inclosed is all
the information I cou’d get from him. I informed him that when
I wrote to him in the country I was imploy’d to look out for a
person in his way, but did not know wether there was now the
same person wanted or not, but wou’d write. At the same time
I ask’d him if he shou’d like to go down into the country to
make a trial for a short time, and see how he was likely to
succeed; but this he seem’d to decline for some time, unless he
went upon a certainty for constant imployment. After drinking a
bowl of punch, he said he wou’d go down to make trial, in case
his expences was all paid up and down, and paid for the time he
was away. He seems to think, before he cou’d attempt doing any
thing, there must be some alteration made to the kiln; but of
this you will be the best judge, if you agree to have him down.
He seems pretty confident they will be glad to have him back
to Lambeth again very soon: in short, he thinks they cannot do
without him. He says they had better a made him a present of
£500 than a parted with him. I have been inform’d thro’ another
hand that had use to work at the manufactory they have had very
great losses in the kilns since he left, and that they have
lost everything in the large kiln. He seems very confident in
succeeding in firing China figures to any size; but of this he
cannot be a judge till a trial is made. After I first see this
man, I went and inform’d Mr. Vulliamy of it, and his advise is
to for you to have him down, tho’ he says he is a drunken bad
chap, but clever in his business. If you shou’d so determine to
have him down, I think sooner the better, as he expects soon to
be call’d to Gen. Conway’s<a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> again, and likewise to fire some
figures, &amp;c., for a Mrs. Dimer,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> in town. He has promis’d
to call again in a few days, therefore you will please to give
your answer. Mr. Vulliamy very much wants two boys of the last
mould sent: begs you will forward them immediately. Mr. V.
inform’d me a few days since that he would write to you the
first opportunity, and am,</p>

<p class="r4 p-min">“Sir, your very obedient servant,</p>

<p>In 1792 the following letter, also in my own possession, was
addressed to Coffee by Miss E. Coade, and shows what a clear-headed,
right-minded, and well-disposed employer she was:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="r2">“Lyme, 25 July, 1792.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Coffee.</span>—I received your third letter, but have
had so many engagements that I cou’d not answer it sooner;
besides that at this distance I can’t speak upon it as if I
were present. I supposed, as you now say, that Mr. Pritchard’s
information against you was in consequence of some quarrell you
had had with him; but I do not justify his manner of taking
revenge, and you are now returning it upon him by acquainting
me of his making tools in my time and selling them, which, as
you say, is a <i>greater</i> crime than what he has charged you
with, and if Mr. Sealy knew it, I can’t suppose he wou’d keep
such a man. But it is always a rule with me to let every man
speak for himself if he can; and, therefore, as I am at such a
distance I must put it by for ye present, or else refer it to
Mr. Sealy, who is ye only judge whether ye hurry of business
will allow of parting with a man or not. <i>You shou’d put
yourself in ye place of a master, and then consider how many
things they have to try them</i>, and how impossible to attend
to ye private quarrells of ye workmen: however, I know Mr.
Sealy is disposed to do justice. You say he behaved very well
to you in ye beginning of this affair, and <i>if he changed his
conduct, it must be in consequence of your improper behaviour
to him</i>. But as it is too late to recall what is past, my
advice to you is to do as you say—return to your work; and
if you are conscious that in your passion you have <i>behaved
disrespectfully to Mr. Sealy, make such acknowledgments to him
as will show your good sense, as well as a sense of duty</i>. I
have no doubt but he would have lent you money if you had asked
it in a becoming spirit. I hope your hand is better and that
you are at work. And <i>wishing you may improve this accident
to your own good</i>, I remain</p>

<p class="r4 p-min">“Your sincere friend,</p>

<p class="r2 p-min">“<span class="smcap">E. Coade</span>.</p>

up by this time, but I hope it will not be long.”</p>

<p><i>The London Pottery</i> is in High Street, Lambeth. It was
established on a small scale in 1751, on a portion of old “Hereford
House,” the palace of one of the former bishops of Hereford, and has
been carried on without intermission, from that time to the present. In
1840 the manufactory came into the hands of Mr. James Stiff, the head
of the present firm of “Messrs. James Stiff &amp; Sons.” At that time the
works consisted only of two kilns (the larger one being only about ten
feet in diameter), and covered an area of probably less than a quarter
of an acre of ground. Since 1840 it has been gradually developed, until
at the present time it comprises fourteen kilns (some of them more
than twenty feet in diameter) and covers an area of about two acres
of ground. It has a very extensive frontage on the Albert Embankment,
overlooking the river Thames, and by means of a private dock, with
entrance under the Embankment, is enabled directly to carry on a very
extensive export trade, and also to import most economically the coals,
clay, and other raw material used in the production of brown and white
stoneware, terra-cotta, &amp;c. Until 1860, when fresh buildings were
erected, a Delft-ware sign-board existed in the front of this pottery.</p>

<p>The <i>four</i> principal kinds of pottery manufactured by Messrs.
Stiff and Sons are: 1. Brown salt-glazed stoneware, in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
tubular socket drain-pipes so extensively made here are produced;
water-filters, jugs, bottles, jars, and all kinds of chemical
apparatus are also made in this class of ware. 2. White stoneware or
“double-glazed” ware, or “Bristol ware,” in which salt is not used, but
the glazing is obtained by the application of a liquid glaze to the
interior and exterior of each article before it is placed in the kiln.
This ware, which is generally made with a rich yellow ochre on the
upper parts of goods, while the lower part is of a creamy-white colour,
has only been introduced into Lambeth about twenty years. It has,
however, to a considerable extent superseded the old brown stoneware,
on account of its superior appearance and cleanliness. 3. Buff
terra-cotta, in which is made garden vases, pedestals, chimney-tops,
window arches, string-courses, &amp;c. This terra-cotta, being thoroughly
vitrified, is valuable for the manufacture of keystones, springers,
string-courses, &amp;c., for buildings where durability is of the very
highest importance; one great advantage (for architectural purposes)
lying in the fact that, in it, the choicest and most elaborate
patterns, either raised or countersunk, can be obtained at little more
than the cost of perfectly plain stone. 4. Porous ware, in which round
and square porous cells, plates, &amp;c., are extensively made, and have
been used by some of the first telegraphic engineers, philosophical
instrument makers, &amp;c., of the day, and have given much satisfaction,
securing, as they do, the greatest amount of porosity, together
with a degree of hardness and fineness of texture which render them
insusceptible of disintegration.</p>

<p>The quality of the stoneware or “Bristol ware” produced at the “London
Pottery” is remarkably good, being extremely hard, and covered with an
excellent, clear, and firm glaze, not surpassed by any other house.
The same remark will apply to the porous ware, which is fine in
composition, and possesses to an eminent degree the porous quality so
essential in vessels of this description. The terra-cotta goods are of
very fine, hard, and durable quality, and of a peculiarly pleasing tone
of colour. Their artistic execution is of a high order, and some of the
designs—as notably the draped bowl and flower-pots which are engraved
on Figs. <a href="#image043a">340 to 342</a>, and <a href="#image143f">345</a>, <a href="#image143g">346</a>.</p>

<p>Messrs. Stiff &amp; Sons produce a large number of filters of excellent
construction and of artistic design. Some of these have Gothic arches,
with figures or armorial decorations, and others are decorated with
elegant foliage; two of these effective designs are shown on Figs. <a href="#image143d">343</a>
and <a href="#image143e">344</a>. These filters have been more than thirty years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span> before the
public. The filtering medium consists of alternate layers of charcoal,
silica, and another purifying substance, all carefully cleansed, and so
arranged as to retain full efficiency for eight or ten years without
further cost or trouble. The “Popular” filter—intended for common use
among all classes—purifies eight gallons of water per day, and is sold
complete and fitted for a mere trifle.</p>

<p>The potteries of Messrs. Stiff &amp; Son are among the largest in London.
They employ about two hundred hands, and their annual import of raw
material, clay, coals, &amp;c., is about 15,000 tons. They have business
relations in almost all parts of the world, and their manufactures
have been admitted to the principal International Exhibitions; their
terra-cotta vases combine excellence of finish with correctness of
design, and are sold at very moderate prices. Their stoneware chemical
apparatus has a very wide reputation, and their drain-pipes and other
sanitary appliances, comprising nearly two-thirds of their business,
have an immense sale.</p>

<p>It is well to add that at this pottery antique jugs and water-jugs,
of excellent design and clever manipulation, are made. The forms are
chaste and good, and they have, partly owing to the care in making,
and partly to the fineness of the glaze, a pleasanter feel to the hand
than others. The carriage and foot warmers, &amp;c., made here are also
extremely good in quality and design.</p>

<p><i>The Lambeth Pottery.</i>—In 1818 Mr. John Doulton established
stoneware works at Vauxhall, and soon afterwards was joined in
partnership by Mr. John Watts, the business being carried on under the
style of Doulton &amp; Watts. Some years after, the works were removed to
High Street, Lambeth, to premises near those which had formerly been
occupied by Mr. Griffiths, already spoken of. In 1858 Mr. Watts died,
and from that time to the present the manufactory has been carried on
by Mr. John Doulton in co-partnership with his sons, under the style
of Doulton &amp; Watts, and Henry Doulton &amp; Co. In 1854 Mr. Henry Doulton
took out a patent for “improvements in kilns used in the manufacture of
stoneware, earthenware, and china.” In 1859 he took out another patent
for “improvements in earthenware jars and bottles,” and in 1861 the
same gentleman also patented his “improvements in the construction of
vats and similar vessels for containing liquids.” At the Exhibitions of
1851 and 1862, medals were awarded to this firm, as they were also at
the Exhibitions at Paris, Hamburg, Oporto, New Zealand, Auxerre, Caen,
and Amsterdam. At the International<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span> Exhibitions of 1871 and 1872 they
also received the highest commendation.</p>

<p>The goods manufactured by Messrs. Doulton &amp; Co. include chemical
vessels of large size (up to 500 gallons) and all kinds of stoneware
suitable for the laboratory and works of the manufacturing
chemist—jars, bottles, jugs, water-filters, and other articles of
domestic use; terra-cotta for architectural and gardening purposes;
drainage pipes, irrigation conduits, sinks, and all kinds of sanitary
ware; plumbago and other crucibles, muffles, furnaces, &amp;c.: and,
in addition to their manufactory at Lambeth, they have works for
the manufacture of sewer pipes, fire goods, blue bricks, &amp;c., at
Rowley-Regis, Staffordshire; Smethwick, Staffordshire; and St. Helen’s,
Lancashire. The various kinds of stoneware and terra-cotta produced by
Messrs. Doulton at their Lambeth works give employment to about six
hundred men; and their consumption of coals at Lambeth alone (exclusive
of the quantity used in their Staffordshire and Lancashire factories)
is over 10,000 tons per annum.</p>

<p>In stoneware—which, like every other branch of the ceramic art,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
has made great progress during the last twenty or thirty years, and
has been made applicable to scores of purposes never dreamed of by
the potters of old—Messrs. Doulton produce, to a very large extent,
bottles, jars, pitchers, and jugs; troughs and pans; feet, carriage,
bed, and other warmers; barrels and taps; filters, filter-stands, and
drip-pans, and every possible variety of household vessels. Besides
these, force-pumps, retorts, receivers, condensing-worms, still-heads,
evaporating dishes and pans, filtering-funnels, percolators, and
every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span> other conceivable kind of chemical and manufacturing vessels
and apparatus, as well as drain-pipes, gullies, sinks, and sanitary
goods, are largely made.</p>

<p>Many of the productions in this stoneware are of extremely artistic
character, and evince a purity of taste which is highly meritorious.
Some of the jugs and tankards, from antique examples, and which are
produced both in brown, blue, claret, and fine white stoneware, are
remarkably chaste and elegant, and remind one of the best periods of
German and Flemish art. The forms are admirable, and the decorations,
whether foliage or animal, incised or in relief, are always thoroughly
well considered, and especially adapted to the material, the mode
of production, and the use of the object. “There are no affected
imitations of antique types. The spirit of true design is caught with
admirable perception and insight, and when colour is introduced, it is
done sparingly, and with a view to enhance the form of the object and
the natural beauty of the material, rather than to conceal either the
one or the other.”</p>

  </div>

<p>In terra-cotta, Messrs. Doulton’s works rank high, both for the
beauty of their productions, the variety of designs they have
introduced, and the durability and excellence of their material. In
vases for gardens, &amp;c.—the finest of which is their Amazon vase
(Fig. <a href="#image147">354</a>) sent to the Exhibition of 1871—Messrs. Doulton produce
a large number of exquisite patterns, as they do also of pedestals,
fountains, garden-seats, flower-boxes, and vases, fern-cases,
flower-pendants, mignionette-boxes, brackets, terminals, &amp;c., which
are all characterized by extreme excellence of design and workmanship.
In statuary and architectural decorations the productions consist
of figures, busts, and medallions; keystones, arches, trusses, and
string-courses; capitals, bases, and finials; window and door heads and
jambs; rain-water heads, of marvellously bold and effective design;
parapets and balustrades; panels of coloured stoneware and terra-cotta,
modelled in very high relief, and mostly of scriptural subjects,
for out-door decoration; tiles and bosses of endless design—some
ornamented in the sgraffito style, and others richly coloured; and
everything requisite for the architect or the builder. Of terra-cotta
flower-pots and fern-cases a large variety are made, all elegant in
shape—some ornamented with masks and medallions, and others with
vegetable composition; and of brackets and pendants the specimens are
very graceful. Painting on pottery has also of late been introduced
into this manufactory with very good results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span></p>

<p>One class of objects to which attention should be called, presents,
in ordinary clays, adaptations in which is conspicuous all the play
of the chastest Greek contours, with all the forms dear to successive
generations of housewives before the revival set in. Prominent are
claret cups, loving cups, hot and cold water jugs, flower vases,
candlesticks, hunting jugs, pitchers, and inkstands, with a great
variety of other vessels. “What particularly arrests the eye in this
branch of the manufacture is, that each object has a style which now
takes us back to the flowery periods of Doric and Etruscan forms, now
to the days of mediæval hospitalities, or to modern instances, by
vessels of form and capacity which would delight even the hearts of
the notoriously beer-loving <i>Burschenschaft</i> of Jena. And it is
necessary to explain that, as these works are not the results of the
common course of earthenware production, it has cost much thought and
the exercise of much knowledge and ingenuity to appoint a confederacy
of labour so particularly qualified as shall work successfully to this
special end.” The ornament is principally the <i>sgraffimento</i>, or
incised outline, which is effected sometimes as soon as the vessel
leaves the wheel, or more generally after it has been allowed partially
to dry to a consistency which will allow of its being handled, though
yet sufficiently soft to admit of being easily worked upon. To the
designs thus engraved in outline, especially to the leafage, colour is
applied with an ordinary water-colour brush, and burnt in. This ware
is called “Doulton ware,” or “Sgraffito ware,” and no two pieces are
formed alike. With regard to the body it will be sufficient to say that
the great strength of stoneware in comparison with that of earthenware,
and also its perfect cleanliness, have secured its adoption, whether
produced by this or any of the other eminent firms who manufacture it,
in all kinds of appliances in connection with drainage and sanitary
engineering; and the perfect resistance it offers to the strongest
acids, proves the material to be admirably fitted for the manufacture
of every kind of vessel and apparatus employed in trades depending in
any degree on chemical operations.</p>


<p><i>Fore Street.</i>—A manufactory of various kinds of pottery existed
here in the beginning of the present century, and was carried on by
Mr. Richard Waters, who in June, 1811, took out a patent for “a new
method of manufacturing pottery ware.” First, “in the fabrication of
various articles of considerable magnitude,” “instead of throwing or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
moulding them on a revolving table, the clay is made into sheets and
then applied upon moulds and finished, by beating or pressure, or by
turning while in a revolving state;” second, forming “delf-ware pots
and other articles by compression of the clay between suitable moulds;”
third, “making or clouding the ‘Welsh ware,’ by using a number of pipes
instead of one in distributing the colour;” fourth, “making earthenware
jambs, tiles for facing houses, and for paving hearths, balustrades,
balconies, and bricks vein-coloured, variegated either by the last
process or by putting together masses differing from each other,” and
in the admixture of stony or metallic or other mineral substances, so
as to differ in their colours and appearance when baked; fifth, by this
process making “figures, statues, ornaments, armorial bearings, and
the like;” sixth, by this process making “stone mortars and pestles,
cisterns, coffins, worms for distillers’ use, tiles, with a hook on the
back instead of a knob, also with a higher edge and deeper return than
usual.”</p>


<p><i>Imperial Pottery.</i>—Another pottery at Lambeth was that of
Messrs. Green &amp; Co., which in 1858 passed, by purchase, into the hands
of Mr. John Cliff, by whom it was considerably enlarged. Mr. Cliff here
brought into use his own “patent kiln for what is known as double glaze
or Bristol glaze kiln, and a circular bag for the salt glaze and pipe
kiln, since adopted generally.” Here also Carr’s “Disintegrant” was
first proved and got to work; and here, under his own eye, Siemens’s
gas furnace was tried on pottery. Here also Mr. Cliff brought out,
and into work, his patent wheel and patent lathe—two most important
improvements in the potter’s art, and said to be the most perfect and
convenient machines extant. The works were closed in 1869, through
the site being required by the Metropolitan Board of Works for
improvements, and Mr. Cliff removed to Runcorn, in Cheshire, where
he still continues his manufactory.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The works were originally
established for the manufacture of common red ware; but after a time
Mr. Green added a little salt-glazed ware; and then, as the double
glazed gained favour, added it, and made it his principal business,
giving up the red ware entirely. Later still, he manufactured drain
pipes and a good deal of chemical stoneware; and, besides all the usual
articles, filters were here extensively made for the celebrated George
Robins, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span> auctioneer. The old works were many times much injured by
fire—being nearly destroyed just before passing into Mr. Cliff’s hands
in 1858.</p>

<p><i>Crispe’s China.</i>—Crispe of Bow Churchyard is said to have had
a manufactory of china ware at Lambeth in the middle of last century;
and to him John Bacon, the sculptor, is stated to have been apprenticed
in 1755. But little is known of this manufactory of Crispe’s, but
reference to him and to his connection with the china trade will be
made in another part of this book.</p>

<p>Several other potteries—one carried on by Mr. Northen, who was an
apprentice to Mr. White of Fulham—existed at Lambeth, but have been
removed, like the “Imperial,” by the improvements on the banks of the
Thames.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Blackfriars Road.</h3>

<p>The terra-cotta works of Messrs. M. H. Blanchard, Son, &amp; Co., were
established in 1839 by Mr. Blanchard, who served his apprenticeship
with Messrs. Coade &amp; Sealey at Lambeth, and they are still carried on
by him and his sons and other partners under the above style.</p>

<p>The terra-cotta goods manufactured by this firm are of remarkably
fine and good quality, and consist of vases, tazzas, statues, busts,
groups of figures, brackets, pedestals, terminals, crosses, fountains,
balustrades, trusses, and every species of architectural enrichment.
In 1851, and again in 1862, as well as at the Paris Exhibition, Mr.
Blanchard was awarded medals for his terra-cotta goods, and they are
considered to be among the best produced, either in this country or on
the Continent. Among the more successful of the works executed by them
may be named the terra-cotta for the Brighton Aquarium; the permanent
buildings, South Kensington Museum; the columns, &amp;c., of the arcades in
the Royal Horticultural Gardens; the Charing Cross and Cannon Street
hotels and termini; the Grosvenor mansions; the Grand Hotel, Cairo;
and the chastely beautiful and effective enrichments of the Wedgwood
Institute, Burslem. Of this last, as one of the greatest achievements
of ceramic art, as applied to external decoration of buildings, I give
a series of engravings. The principal features of these designs are a
series of twelve nearly square panels, in alto-relievo, representing
the months of the year—each month being represented by a seated,
recumbent, or stooping life-size figure, with the attribute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span> of the

the four illustrations here given (Figs. <a href="#image154a">364 to 367</a>) will convey a

<p>Of the general high character for design and workmanship of the
productions of Mr. Blanchard—who ranks among the best in the
kingdom—the objects here engraved will give abundant testimony; and it
only remains to add that the quality of the material and its durability
are fully equalled by the excellence of design of the various articles
produced by this firm.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Vauxhall.</h3>

<p>Thomas Houghton, to whom I have in other parts of this work referred,
in his “Husbandry and Trade Improved,” writing on March 13, 1695–6,
says, speaking of the imports during the year 1694, “of teapots there
came but ten, and those from Holland. To our credit be it spoken, we
have about Faux-Hall (as I have been informed) made a great many,
and I cannot gainsay but they are as good as any come from abroad.”
In 1714 Thoresby writes that he “went by water to Fox-Hall and the
Spring-gardens. After dinner we viewed the pottery and various
apartments there. Was most pleased with that where they were painting
divers colours, which yet appear more beautiful and of divers colours
when baked.” The Vauxhall Pottery is said to have been situated close
by Vauxhall Bridge, in High Street. The Delft-ware Pottery in Princess
Street, Lambeth, is said to have belonged to the same works. The
Vauxhall Pottery, which was for the production of stoneware similar to
that at Lambeth, was carried on towards the close of last century by
a Mr. Wagstaffe; and on his death, in or about 1803, it passed into
the hands of his nephew, Mr. John Wisker, who carried it on until
his decease in 1838, he having, in 1833, taken out a patent “for
certain improvements in machinery or apparatus for grinding covers or
stoppers for jars, bottles, and other vessels made of china, stone,
or other earthenware,” such as are described in the patent of Robert
Burton Cooper taken out in 1831. On the death of Mr. Wisker, the works
were purchased of his executors by Mr. Alfred Singer, but have been
discontinued and pulled down; and the site built over, for some years.
At these works Mr. Singer, in conjunction with Mr. Henry Pether,
manufactured small tiles, or tesseræ, for tesselated pavements. In 1839
they took out a patent “for certain improvements in the preparation
and combination of earthenware or porcelain, for the purpose of
mosaic or tesselated work” “by cutting clay or other plastic material
into rectilinear figures, by means of intersecting wires stretched
in a frame,” and “the forming of ornamental slabs of mosaic work by
cementing together small pieces of porcelain or earthenware, of various
figures and colours, on slabs of slate, stone, or other suitable
material.”</p>

<p>There was another pottery at Vauxhall, where coarse red or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span> brown ware
was made, and where also, later on, a fine stoneware was produced.
There was also a manufactory of white stoneware carried on, in 1811, by
a Mr. Joseph Kishire.</p>


<h3 class="smcap" id="Aldgate">Aldgate.</h3>

<p>In 1690 William Knight was a “Pottmaker” in “the parish of St. Buttolph
without Aldgate, London,” and made “white ware.” In that year he
had conveyed to him, by deed, some premises which were situated “by
the river running from Merton Mill to Wandsworth, in the county of
Surrey,” and consisted in part of a mill, “<i>used for a colour-mill
for grinding colours for the glazeing of white ware</i>” made by him.
The original deed, which is in my own possession, was first made public
by me in my “Reliquary,” and is altogether one of the most interesting
contributions to the history of the ceramic art in England which has of
late been made. The deed is as follows:—</p>

<p>The William Knight, “pott maker,” of this deed was the same William
Knight whose name appears three years later on, in 1693, along with
those of Thomas Harper, Henry De Wilde, John Robins, and Moses
Johnson—“all potters in London”—in the curious “Brief Account of the
Evidence given on behalf of Edmund Warner” in a trial in the Court
of Exchequer, concerning a parcel of Potter’s clay which had been
wrongfully seized as Fuller’s-earth, given on page 134.</p>

<p>“Mary Crispe of the parish of St. Andrewe, Holborne, in the county of
Middx., widow, late wife of Ellis Crispe, late of Wimbledon, in the
county of Surry, Esquire, deceased, and Samuel Crispe of the Inner
Temple, London, Gent., Son and Heire of the said Ellis Crispe,” were,
there can be but little doubt, of the same family to which, later on,
Crispe, the china manufacturer, belonged.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Mill-Wall.</h3>

<p>Mr. Blashfield, now of the Stamford Terra-cotta Works, who had
previously been engaged in the plastic, scagliola, and cement
business, commenced the manufacture of terra-cotta vases, statues,
chimney-shafts, &amp;c., turning to good account the models he had used in
his former business and those he had acquired from Coades. These works
he carried on until 1858, when he removed to Stamford, in Lincolnshire,
and opened his present large manufactory.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Mortlake.</h3>

<p>Delft-ware works appear to have been in existence here in the
seventeenth century. At the close of the eighteenth they were taken by
Mr. Wagstaffe, of the Vauxhall Pottery, and passed with them to his
nephew, Mr. Wisker, about the year 1804, and were by him continued
for the manufacture of Delft and stone-wares until 1820 or 1821, when
he removed the whole concern to Vauxhall. Two examples of Mortlake
Delft-ware—a large punch-bowl, twenty-one inches in diameter, painted
in blue, with birds, flowers, &amp;c.; and a set of twelve tiles, also
painted in blue, with landscape, ruins, figures, &amp;c., are in the South
Kensington Museum. They were removed from the old factory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span></p>


<h3 class="smcap">Southwark.</h3>

<p><i>Gravel Lane.</i>—In the beginning of last century a pottery was
carried on by Nathaniel Oade, connected with whom and whose business
a shocking circumstance is detailed in the <i>Post Boy</i> of March
1st, 1718. It appears that Oade had a family of four sons, who were
determined to have the business and house made over to them, leaving
him to exist on what property he had acquired. This he declined to do;
when they swore they would have it in spite of him, and soon afterwards
had him arrested on judgment in a sham action in the Marshalsea Court
for £500, and thrown into prison. The sons then, with their vile
attorney, conveyed arms and a store of provisions into the house, and
at once turned their mother and servants out and barricaded the place.
“In their rage they shot a woman who was passing by; also their own
mother and a servant who would not give up possession of the books
of account. The constables and the military at length arriving, they
capitulated.” The youngest son and another man were executed for the
murder; the others were found guilty of manslaughter. In 1750 the roof
of a pottery belonging to Mr. Oade was thrown down by an earthquake,
and an account of the circumstance was sent to the Royal Society by
William Jackson, a potter.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Isleworth.</h3>

<p>The manufacture of porcelain at Isleworth was commenced by Joseph Shore
in 1760, and was continued to be made about forty years. In 1795 Lysons
says: “There is a china manufactory at Isleworth belonging to Messrs.
Shore &amp; Co.” In 1800 it was discontinued, but the stock is said to
have remained on the premises until 1830, when the works, having in
the meantime been used for the manufacture of earthenware—principally
“Welsh” or “streaked” ware,—were closed. A few years afterwards the
manufactory was removed to Hounslow, and the site converted to other
purposes. Joseph Shore is said to have come from the Worcester China
Works, and his partner and principal painter, Richard Goulding, was his
son-in-law, who was, later on, assisted by his son, William Goulding
<span class="sni"><span class="smcap">Wm. Goulding</span>,<br>June 20th, 1770.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;✳</span> (a dated
piece of his having the name as in the margin). I am inclined, however,
to think that Joseph Shore must have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span> originally belonged to the Derby
China Works, as several of that name were connected with them. After
Shore’s death, the works were continued by the Gouldings. The works
were at Railshead Creek, by the ferry side.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Stepney.</h3>

<p>A manufacture of porcelain was carried on here in the middle of last
century; for Jonas Hanway, writing in 1750–1, says, “It is with great
satisfaction that I observe the manufactories of Bow, Chelsea, and
Stepney have made such a considerable progress.”</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Greenwich.</h3>

<p>In 1747 it appears there was a small manufactory of china here, but
nothing is known of its history. In the <i>London Tradesman</i> of
that year occurs this note:—“Of late we have made some attempts to
make porcelain or chinaware, after the manner it is done in China
and Dresden. There is a house at Greenwich, and another at Chelsea,
where the undertakers have been for some time trying to imitate that
beautiful manufacture.”</p>

<p><i>Ransome’s Patent Stone Works.</i>—These works, situated at
Blackwall Lane, East Greenwich, were established at Ipswich in 1844,
and removed to this locality in January, 1866. In 1871 the present
company was incorporated in extension of the preceding firm. Mr.
Frederick Ransome, the inventor of the processes, is a member of the
well-known Ipswich family, and was in early life connected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span> with
the Orwell Works firm of Ransomes and Sims. It was while there, and
noticing a workman engaged in dressing a millstone, that he conceived
the idea of producing artificial stone, capable of being moulded to any
form, and to be a perfect imitation, both in appearance and substance,
of the blocks taken from our best quarries. At the commencement Mr.
Ransome had, as I have said, his stoneworks at Ipswich. For ten
years the difficulties he had to encounter were very great, but he
persevered, and, though often discouraged, toiled and experimented on
scientific principles until he succeeded in making not only perfectly
equable and homogeneous grindstones, with keen cutting powers, and
that need no dressing, but also ornamental and decorative stonework
of ornate character, which has been well introduced in the Brighton
Aquarium, London Docks, Albert Bridge, the Indian Court, Whitehall, St.
Thomas’s Hospital, &amp;c., the University of Calcutta and other buildings
in India, and for ornamental buildings in France, Belgium, Holland,
Egypt, Turkey, China (where a splendid fountain of Ransome stone adorns
the public gardens at Hong Kong), and other countries. The demand for
this artificial stone becoming much extended, the inventions were taken
up by a company, and extensive works were erected at East Greenwich,
to which the business was transferred, Mr. Ransome continuing with the
company as managing director.</p>

<p>The works are of great extent, and occupy a space of about four acres,
that was formerly a dreary waste, on the banks of the Thames. They are
connected with the river by a tramway and a jetty, supplied with a
powerful derrick. The works consist of a large covered building, with
a dividing wall across the centre, in which there are two openings for
the tramways that are laid from one end to the other, and on which the
work is conveyed from one point to another as the different processes
require.</p>

<p>The material is, to all intents and purposes, a pure sand-stone, whose
silicious particles are bound together by a cement of silicate of
lime—a mineral substance well known to be of the most indestructible
nature; its composition, mechanically and chemically, is precisely that
of the Craigleith and other best quality building-stones. It can be
moulded to any form while in a plastic state, and can be worked with
the chisel the same as any natural stone. The process of manufacture is
based upon one of the most beautiful of chemical reactions; flints are
dissolved by means of caustic alkali under high pressure, so as to form
silicate of soda, a kind of waterglass.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span> This viscous and tenacious
substance is then rapidly mixed with a proportion of very fine and
sharp silicious sand in a pug mill, so as to form a soft, plastic mass,
which can be moulded into any shape that is desired. The soft stone is
next immersed in a bath of chloride of calcium solution, which is made
to penetrate every pore by means of hydraulic or atmospheric pressure.
Whenever this solution comes into contact with the silicate of soda the
two liquids are mutually and instantaneously decomposed, the silica
taking possession of the calcium and forming the hard, solid silicate
of lime, and the soda uniting with the chlorine to form chloride of
sodium in a small quantity. Instead, then, of the particles of sand
being covered with a thin film of the liquid silicate of soda, they are
covered and united together with a film of solid silicate of lime—one
of the most indestructible substances known. The small quantity of
soluble chloride of sodium, one of the results of decomposition,
is then washed out of the stone by a douche of clean water, or by
hydraulic pressure, its complete removal being ensured by chemical
tests. The stone is then dried and is fit for use.</p>

<p>The productions of these works may be said to comprise most of the
useful as well as ornamental purposes to which stone can be applied.
In the ornamental departments, vases of admirable design and of great
variety, fountains, tazzas (in these three departments some two hundred
different designs are produced), terminals, flower-boxes, flower-pots,
tree-pots, garden edgings, &amp;c. Figures and busts are also produced. In
the more useful architectural departments, chimney-pieces, balustrades,
chimney-shafts and tops, window-heads, vases, plinths, capitals, and
many other articles are made, as well as memorial crosses, gravestones,
cemetery numbers and labels, and other mortuary articles, of such
excellent design and finish as to take the place of real stone, at a
great reduction of cost.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span> Another speciality of the productions of
these works is the manufacture of grindstones and scythe-stones. These
are said to preserve their cutting edges better than stones dressed in
the ordinary way. Filters, too, for reservoirs, are made extensively,
and have the reputation of being the most effective of any introduced.
Pavement tiles, both red, white, grey, and other colours, and also
inlaid in different patterns, are made. These, among other places, have
been adopted on the new Albert Bridge, at Chelsea, with good effect,
and are giving entire satisfaction, on account of their great hardness,
strength, and non-liability to become slippery.</p>

<p>Another admirable and important element of Mr. Ransome’s inventions
is the applying of the silicate of lime to the preservation of stone.
The sculpture on St. George’s Hall, Liverpool, the Custom House at
Greenock, Trinity College, Dublin, and many other public buildings,
have been successfully treated with this solution, which hardens and
renders the surface indestructible by time or weather.</p>

<p>The trade mark of the company, which is the only mark used in this
manufactory, is a winged genius grinding an arrow, from an antique gem
at Rome. It is shown on Fig. <a href="#image165b">373</a>. The works are under the personal
superintendence of Mr. A. Pye-Smith, with Mr. Frederick Ransome as
consulting chemist; Mr. Bessemer is the chairman.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century a pottery existed here, where were
manufactured melting-pots, “the best in the world, especially for
founders.” These were in great repute, and gradually superseded those
imported from Holland, Germany, and Denmark.</p>

<p>About 1830 the manufacture of earthenware (commenced by Joseph Shore
and carried on after his death by his son and grandson Richard and
William Goulding) at Isleworth was removed to Hounslow, but died out in
the course of a year or two, and has not been renewed.</p>

<p>“<i>Nonsuch Pottery.</i>”—A pottery existed here in the early part of
last century, but about, or soon after, 1790, the bed of clay having
been exhausted, it was discontinued. About 1800 the steward of the
Nonsuch estates, on which the pottery was situated, gave permission
for a new pottery to be established wherever the clay could be
found; and soon afterwards the present “Nonsuch Pottery” was opened
in Nonsuch Park. It was founded by Mr. William Richard Waghorn, who
was joined in partnership by his son. This firm continued the works
until 1851, when they were transferred to Mr. Swallow, who had, until
that time, been their foreman. By him and his partner, Mr. Stone, the
business was continued under the style of “Stone and Swallow,” and by
them a pottery—principally for the manufacture of fire-bricks—was
established at Epsom. Mr. Swallow died in 1866 or 1867, and since then
his partner, Mr. Stone, continued the works alone: they are known as
the “Nonsuch Pottery,” or as “Stone’s Ewell and Epsom Potteries.” The
goods manufactured by Mr. W. Waghorn were “Italian tiling”—used very
extensively in the buildings of the time and remarkable for their
strength and durability; ornamental roof tiles; ridge tiles; “Nonsuch
Fire Bricks;” “Nonsuch Fire Loam;” paving and other tiles; moulded
bricks, &amp;c., for Gothic buildings; ornamented chimney-pots; pipes;
flower-pots and vases, &amp;c.; and on their lists was a view of the old
Nonsuch Palace, with an historical notice of the same. At the present
time the same descriptions of goods are produced—the mark, where used,
being simply the words “Stone &amp; Co.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span></p>


<h3 class="smcap">Cheam.</h3>

<p>A pottery was worked here, about 1840, by Messrs. Waghorn, of the Ewell
Pottery; but on their retiring, in 1851, was transferred to Mr. Baker,
by whom it was worked until 1868, when he was succeeded by Messrs.
Cowley &amp; Aston. It was closed in 1869. In the same year another pottery
was opened by Mr. Henry Clark, by whom it is still carried on, for the
manufacture of ornamental and plain flower-pots, rustic fern-stands,
vases, chimney-pots, drain-tiles, &amp;c. They are of a bright red colour,
and when a mark is used, it is simply “Henry Clark, Cheam Pottery.”</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Chiselhurst.</h3>

<p><i>The West Kent Potteries</i> were opened in 1820, before which
time other works were in operation and carried on by the steward of
Lord Sydney, the owner of the estate, for the manufacture of wares
for the use of the estate. At Christmas, 1822, the works were taken
by Mr. Pascall, who continued to carry them on until January, 1869,
when he died in the ninety-second year of his age. Since then it has
been carried on by his sons, Messrs. Pascall Brothers, the present
owners. The productions of the works are the ordinary red-ware flower
and root pots, sea-kale pots, and other horticultural ware: building
and paving bricks and tiles; roofing and ridge tiles; drain, socket,
and other pipes; chimney-tops, &amp;c. Messrs. Pascall are patentees of
the famous West Kent flower-pots with loose bottoms, celebrated for
their convenience for changing and examining the roots; and of the
patent sea-kale pots for growing sea-kale in hothouses. The works are
extensive, and the production of horticultural-ware is large.</p>

<p>“Chelsea buns,” “Chelsea pensioners,” and “Chelsea china” are surely
three things, each one in itself sufficient to make a place famous, but
when brought together, a three-fold fame must certainly attach to the
locality which has given them a name. With the buns and the pensioners,
however, I disclaim all connection in my present work. The former are
not sufficiently works of Art-manufacture to entitle them to a place in
our columns, and the latter are certainly not articles of <i>virtù</i>
which can be collected together and stowed away under glass shades by
the connoisseur. And yet the “Chelsea Bun-house” has its story—full
of interest and of incident—and the “Hospital” has a history and a
host of associations connected with it, which render these two places
memorable, and give them an imperishable interest. It is with the
“China”—the third of the matters I have named, and of whose story
the least is known—that I have now to do. The establishment of the
Bun-house, and its history to the latest time, is easily traced out and
written; the foundation of the Hospital, and the events which have from
time to time filled it with pensioners, are matters of record which
are easily gathered together; but the formation of the china works,
and many of the changes the establishment has undergone, are lost to
us, and will be difficult to recover. It is my object here to attempt
to get back so much as may be of the early history of the works, and
to throw together the scraps I have collected, into the form of a
narrative, which may become the nucleus of a larger and more extended
history, as fresh facts are brought to light in the course of my own
investigations or of those of others interested in the matter.</p>

<p>It is better to state at the outset that the history of the Chelsea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
China Works is very obscure. In fact, a London fog, such as is
proverbial in the month in which I write (November), seems to have
closed around, and enveloped the place in such a dense mass as to make
it next to invisible. A little of this cloud of mist I have already
removed, and I trust that in the course of future researches I may
be able to almost entirely dispel it. At all events, every item of
information is valuable, and in the following narrative a vast deal of
new matter will be found, which will materially assist the collector in
understanding the history of these, the most celebrated of any of the
old china manufactories of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The south-western district of London, on both sides of the water, has,
as I have already shown, for a long period, been the seat of fictile
manufactories of an extensive and important character. Fulham, Chelsea,
Battersea, Vauxhall, Pedler’s Acre, Lambeth—all had their potteries
at an early date, and all, probably, had their origin from one common
source. What that first source was—<i>i.e.</i>, where the first
pottery was founded—is, of course difficult to say, but from it others
sprung up, in different directions, until quite a nest of manufactories
was located in the suburban districts. The artisans of the seventeenth
century were chiefly Dutchmen; indeed, the manufacture was of that
kind of ware known as “Delft-ware”—originally made in Holland, and
introduced into England by workmen from thence. The importation of
“Delft-ware” in this (seventeenth) century was considerable, and at
that period the manufacture of a kind of porcelain is said to have been
achieved at Delft.</p>

<p>I have shown on another page that large quantities of ware were
imported into England from Holland in the seventeenth century, and that
Dutch workmen of skill and enterprise were induced, from the prospect
of a good home trade here, to settle in England. These workmen, it is
not too much to believe, were acquainted with the art of manufacturing
porcelain as produced in Delft, as well as the ordinary kind of ware
made in their native country; and thus the knowledge was brought into
our kingdom, and carried on, to some little extent, by those who
settled here. The first maker of china, as I have shown in my account
of the Fulham Works, was Mr. Dwight, and to him I am inclined to award
the honour of being the father of the Chelsea China Works, about whose
origin so little is known. The probability is that after Dwight had
succeeded in making porcelain, and abandoned it, some other potter
started the works at Chelsea, and with good result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span></p>

<p>When first commenced they were, of course, of a very small size, and
were, it is said, principally confined to painting and finishing
Oriental china, which was imported for that purpose. There is a
tradition—but only tradition—that the origin of the Chelsea works
took its rise from the fact of clay being brought as ballast in vessels
from Chinese ports, which was found to be the veritable clay used by
the Oriental potters. This clay is said to have been used both at
Chelsea and at Bow, and to have enabled the workmen successfully to
compete with their Eastern rivals. The tradition, however, goes on to
recount that the Chinese, finding that the uses of this clay had been
discovered, and perceiving that they were losing trade in consequence,
wisely “stopped the supplies,” and peremptorily refused to allow
any more to leave their ports. The workmen were then driven to seek
elsewhere for material, and, as a matter of course, soon found enough
to use in our country.</p>

<p>By whom the works were carried on in their early days is not recorded,
but in the year 1745 the art had evidently attained a high continental
as well as home celebrity. In this year the French company, in their
petition for the exclusive privilege of establishing a porcelain
manufactory at Vincennes, urged the benefit which France might be
expected to derive by having a manufactory of porcelain which should
counteract the reputation of English and German make, and stop their
importation into France. There is nothing to show that Chelsea, any
more than Bow, was intended by this; but as ten years later, according
to Rouquet, “that of Chelsea is the most considerable” of the three or
four china manufactories in the neighbourhood of London, it is probable
it was then one of the seats of manufacture of which France was jealous.</p>

<p>George II. gave the Chelsea establishment his countenance and earnest
support, and did much to encourage its works, and to ensure its
success. He procured for it workmen, models, and materials from the
State of Saxony, and thus enabled the factory to produce works of
such high merit as to successfully rival the productions of Sèvres
and Dresden. This royal patronage of course produced its results, in
procuring the patronage of many of the leading men of the day. Thus,
the Duke of Cumberland not only took it under his special care, but
allowed a sum of money annually for its furtherance and support. In
1750 it belonged to M. Nicholas Spremont, or Sprimont, a foreigner
of considerable taste and talent, who did much towards establishing
its already acquired reputation. At this time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span> the productions of the
establishment must have been of a particularly high order. In Watkins’s
“Life of Queen Charlotte,” it is stated that “there are several rooms
in Buckingham Palace full of curiosities and valuable movables, but not
ranged in proper order. Among other things I beheld with admiration a
complete service of Chelsea china, rich and beautiful in fancy beyond
expression. I really never saw any Dresden near so fine. Her Majesty
made a present of this choice collection to the duke, her brother—a
present worthy of so great a prince.” Horace Walpole, too, in 1763,
wrote, “I saw yesterday (March 3, 1763) a magnificent service of
Chelsea china, which the king and queen are sending to the Duke of
Mecklenberg. There are dishes and plates without number, an epergne,
candlestick, salt-cellars, sauce-boats, tea and coffee equipages, &amp;c.
In short it is complete, and cost £1,200.”</p>

<p>In the Lansdowne MSS.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> in the British Museum is a curious document
relating to the Chelsea works, which, being particularly interesting,
I here give in full. It is entitled “The case of the Undertaker of the
Chelsea manufacture of Porcelain Ware.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Many attempts towards this art have been made in Europe for a
long course of years past; the success which has been met with
at Dresden has revived these pursuits in many parts of Europe.</p>

<p>“The Empress Queen has a manufacture of her own.</p>

<p>“The French King has one, and has patronised and encouraged
several; the King of Naples has one; the late Duke of Orleans
was, at the time of his death, and had been for many years,
engaged very earnestly in this pursuit, but none have come up
to the pattern they have been endeavouring to imitate.</p>

<p>“Several attempts have likewise been made here; few have made
any progress, and the chief endeavours at Bow have been towards
making a more ordinary sort of ware for common uses.</p>

<p>“This undertaker, a silversmith by profession, from a casual
acquaintance with a chymist who had some knowledge this way,
was tempted to make a trial, which, upon the progress he made,
he was encouraged to pursue with great labour and expense;
and as the town and some of the best judges expressed their
approbation of the essays he produced of his skill, he found
means to engage some assistance.</p>

<p>“The manufacture was then put upon a more extensive footing,
and he had the encouragement of the public to a very great
degree, so that the last winter he sold to the value of more
than £3,500, which is a great deal, considering the thing is
new, and is of so great extent that it has been beyond the
reach of his industry to produce such complete assortments as
are required in a variety of ways. This has been a great spur
to his industry, so that, notwithstanding some discouragements,
the ground-plot of his manufacture has gone on still increasing.</p>

<p>“The discouragements, besides the immense difficulties in
every step towards the improvement of the art, have been the
introduction of immense quantities of Dresden porcelain.</p>

<p>“It was known that, as the laws stand, painted earthenware,
other than that from India, is not enterable at the Custom
House, otherwise than for private use, and of course becomes
forfeit when offered to sale, as well as lace from France, or
any other unenterable commodity; and though it was publicly
sold in a great many shops, and that there were even very
frequent public sales of it, it was hoped that what was exposed
to sale was chiefly the stock in hand, and when that should
be got off, this grievance would cease. It has, nevertheless,
happened quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span> otherwise, for not only the importations
continue, and considerable parcels are allowed to pass at the
Custom House, as for private use, by which means the shops
abound with new stock, and public sales are advertised at the
very beginning of the winter, and in large quantities; but
there is reason to believe, from the diminution in the price of
the Dresden china, that this is done on purpose to crush the
manufactory established here, which was a project threatened
last year.</p>

<p>“It is apprehended that if recourse is had to the Custom House
books, it will be found that considerable quantities have been
entered there for private use, besides what may have been
allowed to pass as Furniture to foreign ministers.</p>

<p>“This earthenware pays eightpence by the pound when entered
for private use; but a figure of very little weight may be
worth five pounds, so that the real value of what is sold here
will be found to be considerable; and, indeed, it must be so,
as this ware makes an important article in a number of great
shops, besides the number of public sales during the course of
a winter, and the other private ways there are of carrying it
about.</p>

<p>“It may be a motive to let it be entered at the Custom
House, that great names are made use of there; but it is to
be regretted, that either these names are often made use of
without authority, or that names are often given for very mean
purposes; and as nobody is named, it may be said that a certain
foreign minister’s house has been, for a course of years, a
warehouse for this commerce, and the large parcel, advertised
for public sale on the seventh of next month, is come, or is to
come from thence.</p>

<p>“Even the right of entering this ware at all is a doubtful
point, and the affirmative is taken upon presumption, because
the law says it shall not be entered for sale.</p>

<p>“The manufacture in England has been carried on so far by
great labour, and at a large expense; it is in many points to
the full as good as the Dresden, and the late Duke of Orleans
told Colonel York that the metal or earth had been tried in
his furnace, and was found to be the best made in Europe.
It is now daily improving, and already employs at least one
hundred hands, of which is a nursery of thirty lads, taken
from the parishes and charity schools, and bred to designing
and painting—arts very much wanted here, and which are of the
greatest use in our silk and printed linen manufactures.</p>

<p>“Besides the advantage great honour accrues to the nation, from
the progress made in so fine an art, without any of those aids
by which it has been set on foot and supported abroad; nor has
there even been any application for new laws or prohibitions
in its favour, which has been a rule in every country upon the
establishment of new manufactures.</p>

<p>“The execution of the laws which have all along been in force,
and which can give no offence to anybody, it is apprehended
will answer the purpose; all that is therefore requested
is, that the Commissioners of the Customs may be cautioned
with regard to the admission of this ware under the pretence
of private use, and that the public sale of it may not be
permitted any more than that of other prohibited goods. A
few examples of seizures would put a stop to this, and which
cannot be difficult, as all Dresden china has a sure mark to
distinguish it by; but if this commerce is permitted to go on,
the match between a crowned head and private people must be
very unequal, and the possessors of the foreign manufactures
will at any time, by the sacrifice of a few thousand pounds,
have it in their power to ruin any undertaking of this kind
here.</p>

<p>“This must be the case at present with the Chelsea manufacture,
unless the administration will be pleased to interpose,
and enjoin, in the proper place, a strict attention to the
execution of the laws; for if, while the manufacture is filled
with ware, these public sales of, and the several shops
furnished with, what is prohibited, are to take off the ready
money which should enable the manufacturer to go on, it must
come to a stop, to the public detriment, and the ruin of the
undertaker, as well as great loss to those who have engaged in
his support.”</p>
</div>

<p>Who the “undertaker” of the works here referred to was, is not stated
in the document, which, according to Mr. Franks, bears internal
evidence of having been written after 1752 and before 1759. Whether
the Customs acceded to his views or not does not appear; but certain
it is that, despite the abuse of import privilege enjoyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span> by cabinet
ministers and others, he was, by his own showing, carrying on a very
extensive business, selling £3,500 worth of goods in one winter, and
employing more than a hundred hands, including a nursery of about
thirty lads, who were learning the arts of potting and painting.</p>

<p>In 1754 the following advertisement, which is most important as showing
the class of goods then made at Chelsea, appeared in the <i>Public
Advertiser</i> of December 17th:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To be sold by auction, by Mr. Ford, at his Great Room, in
St. James’s, Hay-Market, this and four following days. All
the entire stock of Chelsea porcelain toys, brought from the
proprietor’s warehouse in Pall Mall; consisting of snuff-boxes,
smelling-bottles, and trinkets for watches (mounted in gold
and unmounted) in various beautiful shapes, of an elegant
design, and curiously painted in enamel, a large parcell of
knife-hafts, &amp;c. The said stock may be viewed till the time of
sale, which will begin each day at half an hour after eleven
o’clock. Note.—Most of the above things are in lots suitable
for jewellers, goldsmiths, toyshops, china-shops, cutlers, and
workmen in those branches of business. Catalogues may be had at
Mr. Ford’s, at sixpence each, which will be allowed to those
who are purchasers.”</p>
</div>

<p>In Mr. Franks’s possession, and in other collections, examples of these
“toys” are preserved. Mr. Franks has a smelling-bottle in form of a
group, being a boy seated and writing a letter, while a girl looks
on: the letter is inscribed, “Fe: 1759, This is.” In that year a Mr.
Hughes, an ironmonger in Pall Mall, in his advertisement of May 2nd—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Begs leave to inform the nobility, gentry, and others, that he
has a greater choice of the Chelsea Porcelain than any dealer
in London, both useful and ornamental; and as they were bought
cheap can be sold more reasonable than they can be made at the
manufactory. He has compleat services of plates and dishes,
tureens, sauce-boats, &amp;c., which no one else has; several
elegant epargnes for desarts, and one beautiful one bought at
the last sale; several figures and greatest choice of branches
with the best flowers, such as were on the chandelier at the
last sale; and upwards of three thousand of those flowers to
be sold by themselves, so that ladies or gentlemen may make
use of them in grottos, branches, epargnes, flower-pots, &amp;c.,
agreeable to their own taste.”</p>
</div>

<p>After much research I find that Mr. Spremont continued the works until
1768 or 1769, when he retired, principally through ill health,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
after having amassed a comfortable fortune; his ledgers dating from
1759 to 1768. During the time of his carrying on the establishment the
works were very flourishing—indeed, it was said that “the china was in
such repute as to be sold by auction; and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span> a set was purchased as
soon as baked, dealers were surrounding the doors for that purpose.”</p>

<p>Mr. Spremont’s managing man was Francis Thomas, of whom I shall
have a few words to say presently. When Spremont retired from the
concern, it was purchased by, or assigned over to, Mr. James Cox,
who engaged Francis Thomas as overseer, at a salary of £100 a year,
and this arrangement continued to the 6th of January, 1770, when Mr.
Thomas died. Shortly afterwards the concern again, and for the last
time, changed hands. Mr. Thomas was a man of good ability and of much
practical skill, and to his energy in directing the works under Mr.
Spremont much of their fame may be traced. He was buried in the south
aisle of the parish church of Chelsea, where an inscription to his
memory now remains.</p>

<p>I have in my possession a bill from Elizabeth, widow of Francis Thomas,
which is somewhat interesting, as refuting the statements which have
been made as to the position held by this gentleman, and which I
therefore give entire:—</p>

<p>The following announcements refer to the sales and proposed sales of
the manufactory, and its models, plant, &amp;c.:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1764. “To be sold by auction, by Mr. Burnsall, on the premises,
some time in March next (1764), at the Chelsea porcelane
manufactory. Every thing in general belonging to it, and all
the remaining unfinished peices, glazed and unglazed; some
imperfect enamelled ditto of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span> the useful and ornamental, all
the meterials, the valuable and extensive variety of fine
models in wax, in brass, and in lead; all the plaster molds
and others, the mills, kilns, and iron presses; together with
all the fixtures of the different warehouses; likewise all the
outbuildings, &amp;c., &amp;c. And as Mr. Sprimont, the sole possessor
of this rare porcelane secret, is advised to go to the German
spaw, all his genuine household furniture, &amp;c., will be sold at
the same time.</p>

<p>“N.B.—Soon after, when every thing is sold belonging to the
manufactory, &amp;c., and the large warehouse cleared, there will
be some most beautiful peices of the truly inimitable Marazine
blus, crimson, and gold, that Mr. Sprimount has thought
deserving finishing; that will be sold at Chelsea, as the whole
remaining and the last produce of that once most magnificent
porcelane manufactory.”</p>

<p>(April 1769) “To all proprietors of porcelane manufactories
and others; there is to be sold at the Chelsea manufactory,
by order of the proprietor (having recently left off making
the same), every thing in general belonging to it, as all the
plaster moulds, models in wax, lead and brass; kilns, mills,
iron presses, and a large quantity of biscuit work, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
likewise all the buildings and many other articles. For further
particulars, enquire of Mr. Thomas at the said manufactory.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the <i>Gazetteer, or New Daily Advertiser</i>, for May, 1769, is the
following advertisement:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To be sold by auction, by Mr. Burnsall, at his auction room
in Charles Street, Berkeley Square, on Wednesday, the 17th of
May, and the following days, by order of Mr. Nicholas Sprimont,
the proprietor of the Chelsea Porcelain Manufactory, he having
entirely left off making the same, all the curious and truly
matchless pieces of that valuable manufactory; consisting of
beautiful vases, antique urns, perfume pots, table and dessart
services, tea and coffee equipages, compatiers, leaves, &amp;c.,
beautiful candlesticks of different shapes; variety of figures,
very large and curious groups, particularly two groups of
Roman charity, toilet boxes of various forms and sizes, and
many other articles, most highly finished in the mazarine
blue, crimson, pea-green, and gold, finely painted in figures,
birds, fruit, and flowers, enriched with gold and curiously
chased. To be viewed on Monday the 15th, and till the sale.
N.B.—Likewise will be sold all the fine models, mills, kilns,
presses, buildings, and all other articles belonging to this
most distinguished manufactory. For further particulars apply
to the said Mr. Burnsall.”</p>
</div>

<p>In reference to this last advertisement, Josiah Wedgwood thus wrote to
Thomas Bentley:—“The Chelsea moulds, models, &amp;c., are to be sold, but
I’ll enclose you the advertisement—there’s an immense amount of fine
things;” and about the same date, writing to his clerk, William Cox, he
says:—“Pray enquire of Mr. Thomas whether they are determined to sell
less than the whole of the models, &amp;c., together: if so I do not think
it would suit me to purchase. I should be glad if you could send me any
further particulars of the things at Chelsea.”</p>

<p>About this time Dr. Johnson was busying himself in experimentalising
in compositions for the manufacture of porcelain, and an interesting
account of his progress at Chelsea, as given from the lips of the
foreman of the works, is preserved by Faulkener. He says, in his
“History of Chelsea:”—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. H. Stephens was told by the foreman of the Chelsea China
Manufactory (then in the workhouse of St. Luke’s, Middlesex),
that Dr. Johnson had conceived a notion that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span> capable
of improving on the manufacture. He even applied to the
directors of the Chelsea China Works, and was allowed to bake
his compositions in their ovens in Lawrence Street, Chelsea.
He was accordingly accustomed to go down with his housekeeper
about twice a week, and stayed the whole day, she carrying a
basket of provisions with her. The Doctor, who was not allowed
to enter the mixing-room, had access to every other part of the
house, and formed his composition in a particular apartment,
without being overlooked by anyone. He had also free access to
the oven, and superintended the whole process, but completely
failed, both as to composition and baking, for his materials
always yielded to the intensity of the heat, while those of
the Company came out of the furnace perfect and complete.
The Doctor retired in disgust, though not in despair, for he
afterwards gave a dissertation on this very subject in his
works; but the overseer (he was still living in the spring of
1814) assured Mr. Stephens that he (the overseer) was still
ignorant of the nature of the operation. He seemed to think
that the Doctor imagined one single substance was sufficient,
while he, on the other hand, asserted that he always used
sixteen; and he must have had some practice, as he had nearly
lost his eyesight by firing batches of china, both at Chelsea
and at Derby, to which the manufacture was afterwards carried.”</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. Johnson certainly took much interest in the manufacture of
porcelain, and after the discontinuance of the Chelsea works visited
those at Derby. He does not, however, seem to have carried his
researches on to any practical result.</p>

<p>In 1769 Mr. William Duesbury, the proprietor of the famous Derby China
Works, became the purchaser of the Chelsea works, and for many years
carried on the two establishments conjointly. The Derby works had at
that time attained to a high degree of excellence and of celebrity,
and Mr. Duesbury (who became the purchaser, not only of the Chelsea
works, but those of Bow, Giles’s, Pedlar’s Acre, &amp;c.) was doing more
trade than was done at any other establishment in the kingdom. He had
opened an extensive connection with London, and was rapidly increasing
his concern, both in that and other markets, and had become more than a
successful rivaller of the excellence of the Chelsea wares.</p>

<p>The purchase of the Chelsea works was arranged on the 17th of August,
1769, and completed on the 5th of February, 1770, when a payment of
£400, in part of the purchase money, was made. The original document,
now in my possession, is highly interesting, and is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Recd. London, 5th Feby. 1770, of Mr. Wm. Duesbury, four
hundred pounds, in part of the purchase of the Chelsea
Porcelain Manufactory and its apurtenances and lease thereof,
which I promise to assign over to him on or before the 8th
instant.</p>

<p class="r2 p-min"><span class="smcap">“James Cox.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>Thus the Chelsea works, which had been taken to by Mr. Duesbury in
August, 1769, and had been, indeed, carried on at his cost from about
that period, finally passed into his hands on the 8th of February,
1770. The purchase included not only the “Porcelain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span> manufactory and
its appurtenances and the lease thereof,” but the stock of finished
and unfinished goods then on the premises; and this gave rise to a
long and tedious lawsuit, of which I shall have to speak hereafter.
Mr. Duesbury also, it would appear, covenanted to pay all liabilities
on the estate, and of course to receive all moneys due to it. At the
foot of the bill from Mrs. Thomas to Mr. Cox, printed above, there is
this very significant foot-note:—“Mr. Cox sold Mr. Deusbury the whole,
who was to pay the above, and every other matter.” Other bills, in my
possession, including one from William Payne, the carpenter, for £19
15<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>, for repairs done at the works for Mr. Cox, are
endorsed as paid by Mr. Duesbury. In this carpenters bill one item
shows that the works were palisadoed:—“Dec. 9, 1769. To repairing the
yard gates and palisades, setting on locks, 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>”
The accounts do not appear to have been quite cleared up until the
year 1780, when, upon the winding up of the affairs of Mr. Cox, on his
failure or death, a claim was made on Mr. Duesbury by the solicitor,
Mr. Jasper Jay, for balance of account as then “standing open in the
books of Mr. Cox.” The account is but short; but as all this is useful
material towards the history of the Chelsea works, and is therefore of
importance, I give it entire.</p>

<p>The lawsuit to which I have alluded was commenced the same year that
the works finally passed into the hands of Mr. Duesbury, and was
brought by that gentleman against Burnsall (I presume the auctioneer
named above), to recover a quantity of goods said to have been
unlawfully sold to him by Francis Thomas, and which in reality belonged
to Duesbury, as a part of his purchase. The goods, which appear to
have been made by Spremont, and of his own materials, were alleged by
Thomas to have been sold to him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span> by Spremont; but although the books
of the concern were kept by Thomas himself, no entry of such sale and
purchase was to be found. There were also cross actions. The action was
first heard in Michaelmas Term, 1770, and lasted until Hilary Term,
1772. Evidence was given that the articles demanded of Burnsall were
made of Mr. Spremont’s materials, and at his manufactory; that Mr.
Spremont never sold them to Thomas, and that they were found in rooms
lately belonging to the factory, and were therefore included in Mr.
Duesbury’s purchase by the formal words. Mr. Spremont, whose health had
been gradually failing, died while the action was going on, in June,
1771, and in the end the defendant Burnsall’s counsel, representing
to the court “Mrs. Thomas’s situation in a madhouse, and four small
children, and the attorney swearing that there was nothing else for to
support them, the court would not let us keep the action at law any
longer in court, so we must pay the costs.” The action thus came to an
end, and Burnsall immediately announced a sale of china, “in which are
some capital pieces of Chelsea porcelain”—a part, doubtless, of the
disputed goods.</p>

<p>Under Mr. Duesbury, the manager of the Chelsea works, was Richard
Barton (a modeller and general workman); and the “weekly bills” of
wages and disbursements, now in my possession, as made out by him, are
highly interesting and valuable, as showing the kind of articles then
made at Chelsea, the names of the workmen and painters, and the amounts
earned by each from week to week. These bills commence in March, 1770,
and run over the next three or more years. The final destruction of
the works is carefully described in some excellent letters, also in my
possession, to which I shall refer later on.</p>

<p>From these “weekly bills” I have selected some items which are of more
than passing interest, and which tend, more materially than other
information can, to throw light on the Chelsea works at this particular
period—a period, it must be borne in mind, <i>later</i> than that
at which the works are generally said to have been discontinued. It
must be remembered that, until my account of the “Derby China Works”
appeared in the columns of the <i>Art-Journal</i>, in 1862, nothing
had ever been known of the connection of Duesbury with the concern.
The information I there gave of his purchase of the Chelsea factory
was new; and upon what I then wrote every later account of the Chelsea
works has been founded. The works were till then generally believed to
have been discontinued in 1765,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span> but I have been enabled to show that
they were not finally given up until 1784, when the kilns were taken
down.</p>

<p>In June, 1776, her Majesty Queen Charlotte paid a visit to Duesbury’s
London Show Rooms in Bedford Street, Covent Garden, and was shown
through by his agent, Mr. Wood. The following is an account of the
event:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On Friday last <i>her Majesty</i> accompany’d with the
Dutchess of Ancaster was pleased to honor with her presence
Mr. Duesburys Ware Rooms in Bedford Street, Covent Garden,
condescended to express great approbation at those beautiful
articles of Derby and Chelsea porcelain, and patronize and
encourage the same by making some purchases.”</p>
</div>

<p>The “weekly bills” of the Chelsea China Works, in my own possession,
are very carefully prepared, and give the names and salaries of the
workmen employed, as well as the kinds of goods they were engaged in
making. They are thus particularly interesting and important, and are
calculated to throw no little light on the history of the works. I
quote two weeks in full, May 12th to 19th, 1770; and March 16th to
23rd, 1771, as examples of the style of these “weekly bills;” and I
have added to these some few extracts, to show the kind of ware then
being made, and the prices which the workmen received for painting, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Mr. Duesbury continued working the manufactory at Chelsea, together
with his large and important works at Derby, until the year 1784, when
he pulled down the buildings, removed all that was useful to Derby, and
so totally put an end to the manufacture of “Chelsea China.” For some
years he had been gradually drafting off the workmen, models, &amp;c., to
Derby, and in the end finally gave up the manufacture at Chelsea, and
continued his works, entire, at their original place, Derby.</p>

<p>It has been said, and generally believed, that the excellence of the
Derby works dates from the time when the Chelsea workmen and the
Chelsea models were brought to it; but this is, undoubtedly, a great
and a grave error. The truth is, the Derby works had risen to such
extreme eminence, and had attained to so high a degree of excellence,
as to more than rival Chelsea, which, in consequence, began to decline.
The successful owner of the Derby establishment was thus enabled to
purchase the Chelsea works, as he also did those of Bow, and to carry
them on, as long as he considered advisable, conjointly.</p>

<p>I am enabled to give copies of two letters now in my possession,
describing the taking down of the buildings, the removal of some of
the kilns to Derby, and the arrangement made with the old and faithful
workman, Robert Boyer, whose name appears so regularly on the “weekly
bills.” The letters are much decayed and mutilated, but fortunately are
decipherable. They will be read with much gratification by all who take
an interest in the history of Chelsea and its China works.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="r2">“<i>Laurence Strt., Chelsea, Feby. 18th, 1784.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—I Wright to Inform yow how we are pretty
forward in the pulling Down of the buildings at Chelsea. I
think a little better than a fortnight they will be all down
to the ground and Cleared of the primeses, wich I shall be
glad to my hart, for I am tired of it. Mr. Lygo<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> says yow
would wish to have the Ion Kiln Cum to Derby. Its hardley worth
sending, for the Corners are a good deail burnt at the Bottom,
and the sides are opend or Drawd so much as 4 or 5 Inches on
each side. But if yow chuse to have it Cum, say how it shall
be sent—by Land or Water, and I will send it. I wish yow
will Lett me no if yow will have the mold of the Large figur
of Brittannia sent to the warehous or Broake. Now, sir, as my
time at Chelsea draws nigh to a conclution, I should beg of yow
to Informe me by letter what yow mean to Imploy me abought at
your manufactory, In case yow &amp; myself should settle on Tirms
agreable. Yow now allow me one Ginue p<sup>r</sup> Week, house Rent, and
fire; and I dont make aney Doubght But I shall be found a very
Uceful servant to yow if I Cum, &amp; must beg of Yow to say if
25/- p<sup>r</sup> week will be to much to Give me, and house rent free,
as I have always had of yow. I make no Dought but yow will
please to say what yow will allow me for the Removall of my
Famaley. We have 4 children, my wife and self, wich will Cost a
deal of money—and thats an articall wich is scarce w<sup>th</sup> mee.
I have had severall offers of places’s since the manufactory
has bin pulling Down, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span> Refus’d them all, Becaus it would
have been Wicked in me to have Left yow in such a [&emsp;&emsp;]
till I had seen your property Cleared off. If I am [&emsp;&emsp;]
Constant at the kilns, I must begg Leaf to [&emsp;&emsp;] at all;
But I have no Objection to fire [&emsp;&emsp;] aney Rich ware in
such a kiln as I have at [&emsp;&emsp;]; and if Tirms are such as
yow may approve, pleas to say; but I Due not like to Cum so
maney miles from London on an Uncertinty, therefore it will be
nesesary to have articals drawd for 3, five, or 7 years, as is
agreable to yow. I have carrid Mr. Lygo a bove sixty-six pounds
this week, wich I found to be very seasonable. I was very much
shock’d, sir, when I heard yow had been so Dangeresly Ill, But
am happy to find yow are so much better than yow was, &amp; God
send yow may Continue to Gett mending for the Best. Should I
Cum to Derby, I shall bring nothing with me but my Beds—Land
Carridge Cums to a Deal of Money; in short, my Goods are But
old, therefore they shall all be sold.</p>

<p class="r4 p-min">“I am, with Respects, your Obt. Humb<sup>le</sup> Servt.,</p>

<p class="r2 p-min">“<span class="smcap">Robt. Boyer</span>.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lygo desir’d me to wright to yow a bought my Cuming down,
wich I should have Done if he had not Desired me.”</p>
</div>

<p>To this letter Mr. Duesbury, who bore a most excellent character for
kindness and consideration towards his work-people and servants,
evidently returned a satisfactory and pleasant reply, as is evidenced
by the following letter from Boyer:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="r2">“<i>Chelsea, March 28th, 1784.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—I have your letter of the 24th inst., and am
much oblig’d to yow for all past favours, and am happy in
finding that yow are satisfide with my past Conduct. Now, sir,
as yow due agree to the terms which my letter expresses, and as
yow have alway’s behav’d with a Deal of kindness towards me,
I therefore Due asure yow that while I am with yow, yow shall
ever find me a faithful and honest sarvant, and I further do
asure yow that, I will make my self as sarvicable as it Lays
in my power, so that yow shall have no Reason to find aney
fault with me. I make no doubght but yow will find me very
servicable, &amp; will Due every thing in my power to forward your
Bisness. I hope we shall gett done hear in a short time: the
peopl are all busey in getting their things of the primeses as
fast as they possibley Can. I hope to be Down at Derby with
yow in a short Time, as soon as I can gett my matters a Little
to gather. Yow shall have the Ion Kiln down by the waggon next
week w<sup>th</sup> ought faile. I could not Lett it Cum this week on
account of things I had by me wich wanted firing that I never
had time to fire till this week. The Lapaderys wheel is packed
in a hogshead now at sea, No. 16. Mr. Lygo has been Taulking
w<sup>th</sup> me a bought the Burnishing: he complains of its being
full of scratches, wich will ever be the Consequense if your
burnishing tools are not kept in good order; that is to say,
Lett them always be kept with a good polish on them, and then
they never will have aney scratches to be seen on the gold. I
wish you will let me no what I shall due with your 4 Chears,
Table, Looking Glass, and Sofee, that is in the Dining Room at
Chelsea. I sopose they may go to the warehouse. The Liqurs &amp;ca.
ought of the seller is gone there ever since a Little after
Christmas.</p>

</div>

<p>In the former of these two letters it will have been observed that
mention is made of a “mould of the large figure of Britannia;” this was
one of the finest figures produced at Chelsea or Derby, and is now of
great rarity.</p>

<p>The “hands” employed at Chelsea, so far as they are entered in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span> these
“weekly bills,” appear to have been as follows. I give their names and

<p>During the time the Chelsea and Derby works were carried on conjointly,
the proprietor held periodical sales by Messrs. Christie and Ansell,
“at their Great Room, next Cumberland House, Pall Mall,” and afterwards
“by the Candle,” at his own warehouse, by Mr. William Hunter of New
Bond Street. Of many of these sales (see “Derby” china works) I possess
catalogues—some of them priced; and they are particularly valuable
and interesting as describing the articles made at the period. The
goods offered for sale were evidently the best that were produced, and
many of them are of a most costly and magnificent character. From the
catalogues of 1781 and 1782—three years before the Chelsea works were
taken down—I have selected a few examples:—</p>

<p>The manufactory was situated in Lawrence Street, Chelsea, at the corner
of Justice Walk, and was held by Mr. Spremont—or, at all events, one
house was—at the yearly rental of £24.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sept. 5th, 1770. Recd. of Mr. Sproemont, by the Hands of Mr.
Morgan, Twelve Pound for Half a Years Rent, Due for a House

Executor to the late Mr. Chas. Ross, £12.</p>
</div>

<p>Several of the adjoining houses are said to have been used as show and
ware rooms; but the whole of the premises have been, of course, rebuilt
many years. In a pleasant gossiping conversation between Nollekins,
the sculptor, and Betew, a friend of Hogarth, related in Smith’s “Life
of Nollekins,” the following allusion to the works and its situation
is made:—“The factory stood just below the bridge, upon the site of
Lord Dartery’s House. ‘My father worked for them at one time,’ said
Nollekins. ‘Yes,’ replied Betew, ‘and Sir James Thornhill designed for
them. Mr. Walpole has at Strawberry Hill half-a-dozen china plates by
Sir James, which he bought at Mr. Hogarth’s sale.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Paul Ferg painted
for them. The cunning rogues produced very white and delicate ware,
but then they had their clay from China, which when the Chinese found
out, they would not let the captains have any more for ballast, and the
consequence was that the whole concern failed.’”</p>

<p>It is much to be regretted that no view of the works is known to be in
existence; and their absolute site is not, as far as I am aware, marked
on any plan of the locality.</p>

<p>The following relate to these works, and possess more than a passing
interest:—</p>

<p>The body of the Chelsea china is very frequently uneven—<i>i.e.</i>
it has often the appearance of being unequally mixed. One of its
peculiarities is that it would bear no fresh exposure to the heat
of the kiln, and consequently could not be re-painted and altered.
The second application of heat would most probably end in the entire
cracking and destruction of the piece. The body was not so compact as
the Derby, and of very different general character from Worcester.</p>

<p>The earliest examples made at Chelsea I believe to have been the
ordinary white with blue patterns, after the Delft and other makes; and
in these early days no marks were used. The glaze, too, was somewhat
thick and clumsy, and unevenly laid on. A little later on, Oriental
patterns were copied very successfully, both in blue and white and in
mixed colours, and the potting became careful and less clumsy. Some
early specimens of cups and saucers copied from Oriental patterns,
which I have seen, are remarkably well potted, and bear a wonderfully
close resemblance to the originals, both in body and in ornamentation.
The best Oriental specimens which could be had were, however, used
as models, as were also those of France and Germany; and very soon
the articles produced at Chelsea most successfully rivalled the
best productions of Dresden and Sèvres, both in modelling, potting,
colouring, and glazing. The colours were remarkably fine and vivid; and
as only the best artists were employed as painters, the pieces produced
were extremely choice and good. Many of the landscapes, of which
Boreman (or Bowman) was for a long time the chief painter, are in most
exquisite taste, both in colouring and choice of subject. The groups of
figures, historical, mythological, or otherwise, are, too, remarkably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
fine, and evince a correct taste and a high degree of manipulation on
the part of the artists employed. In modelling, Bacon, Nollekins, and
many other of the most eminent men were employed, and the figures they
produced were of the highest possible degree of beauty.</p>

<p>In flowers and insects, the Chelsea painters were particularly happy
and successful, and they had a peculiar “knack” in “accidental
arrangement” which produced a most pleasing effect. Thus, on a plate or
dish, the little groups or single sprigs of flowers were often thrown
on, as it were, “hap-hazard” along with butterflies, bees, lady-cows,
flies, moths, and other insects, and thus produced a pleasing, because
an apparently unstudied, effect. The raised flowers, arranged on vases
and other ornamental pieces, are usually of extremely good character,
and are well painted; and the birds and figures which are introduced
along with them are also very nicely and carefully modelled.</p>

<p>Specimens of Chelsea china are to be found in most collections, both
public and private, and, being much sought after, usually produce high
prices when offered for sale. It may be well, as a guide to collectors,
to quote the prices which have been realised in some few instances. In
the Bernal collection were the following:—</p>

<ul class="smaller">
  <li class="hangingindent">A pair of oval Dishes, crimson borders, painted with birds,
butterflies, and fruit, sold for thirteen guineas.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span></li>
  <li class="hangingindent">A pair of beautiful globular scalloped Vases and covers, deep
blue, painted with exotic birds with pierced borders and covers
of the highest quality, were bought by Mr. Addington for £110
5<i>s.</i></li>
  <li class="hangingindent">An imperfect (chipped) Cup and Saucer, with festoons raised in
white, sold for a guinea.</li>
  <li class="hangingindent">Another Cup and Saucer, with flowers and crimson drapery edge,
sold for three guineas and a half.</li>
  <li class="hangingindent">A beautiful two-handled Cup and Saucer, with medallions of
Cupids in pink, and striped gold sides, realised twenty-one
pounds.</li>
  <li class="hangingindent">An Ecuelle, cover, and stand, with pink scalloped edges, and
delicately painted sprigs of flowers, sold for £27 6<i>s.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>At the sale of the late Queen Charlotte’s collection, the Chelsea
porcelain realised in many instances very exorbitant prices. At the
Strawberry Hill sale a pair of cups of the famed claret colour, without
saucers, enriched with figures of gold, sold for 25 guineas. Another
pair, blue, with gold figures, sold for 17 guineas; and a similar
pair, with groups of flowers on a ground of gold, made £11 6<i>s.</i>
At the sale of the Angerstein collection a pair of bleu-de-roi vases,
with paintings, were bought by Lord Kilmory for 100 guineas. Another
pair, pink and gold ground, with paintings, and with open-work lips,
realised 142 guineas. A single vase and cover, from Queen Charlotte’s
collection, sold for 106 guineas; and a pair of splendid globular vases
and covers, with paintings of Bathsheba and Susanna, realised 203
guineas.</p>

  </div>

<p>In the British Museum are some good examples of Chelsea porcelain,
presented to that Institution in 1763; and in the Museum of Practical
Geology, in Jermyn Street, are also some excellent specimens, which can
be examined by the collector. The Foundling Hospital, until recently,
possessed a remarkably fine blue vase, richly gilt and painted, which
was presented to that excellent institution in 1763, during the time
the works were in the hands of Mr. Spremont, by Dr. Garnier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Foundling Hospital.</i>—At a Meeting of the Committee,
Wednesday, 20 April, 1763, the Treasurer acquainted the
Committee that he has received from Dr. Geo. Garnier a fine
vase of porcelain, made at Chelsea.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>,—That the Treasurer be desired to direct that
a glass case be made for the safe keeping of the said vase, to
be placed in the Committee-room of this hospital.</p>
</div>

<p>The vase, which has been broken, has passed by purchase into the hands
of the Earl of Dudley, who, about the same time, became the purchaser,
for the sum of £2,000, of the famous vase belonging to the late Earl of
Chesterfield.</p>

<p>The earliest specimens of Chelsea ware have no mark, and can only be
judged by the body, the general style of workmanship, and the glaze.
But it is difficult correctly to appropriate many examples, especially
those in which the <i>painting</i> alone was Chelsea work on foreign
bodies. In many of the old examples the marks produced by the triangle
or tripod are said to be indicative of the Chelsea works; but this is
by no means to be relied on, as the same appearances are frequently
found on the productions of other work.</p>

<p>The general distinctive mark of Chelsea is an anchor—sometimes drawn
with the pencil, at others raised from a hollow mould; and this is
used either singly, two together, or in conjunction with one or more
daggers. It is usually said that the raised anchor is the oldest mark;
but this can scarcely be depended on, for instances are known where, on
the same set, the <i>raised</i> anchor appears on some of the pieces,
while the anchor drawn with the pencil occurs on others.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> This being
the case, it is difficult to decide which is the oldest; but, judging
from the workmanship of the specimens I have examined, I should feel
inclined to say that the earliest mark was the simple plain anchor,
drawn on the piece with the hair pencil, in the colour which the
workman happened to have in use at the time. It has been asserted that
the mark of the best kind of porcelain was an anchor in gold, and of
the inferior an anchor in red. This is, however, erroneous: the quality
of the body had nothing whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span> to do with it, and I believe the
golden anchor is never found on pieces except where gold is used in the
ornamentation. The raised anchor <img src="images/image193a.jpg" alt=""
style="height:2em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">
appears on the cup and saucer.</p>

<p>One of the most, if not the most, interesting marks connected with
Chelsea occurs on a cream ewer formerly belonging to Dr. Wellesley,
and afterwards to Mr. W. Russell, the Accountant-General. One of the
marks usually ascribed to the Bow works is the triangle (Fig. <a href="#image">378</a>);
<img src="images/image193b.jpg" id="image193b" alt=""
style="height:3em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">
and in the Museum of Practical Geology is a cream ewer bearing this
mark in the paste. This specimen was formerly in the Strawberry Hill
collection, and afterwards in Mr. Bandinell’s. The cream ewer which
belonged to Mr. Russell is moulded in the same mould, and is, in fact,
identically the same as the one in the Museum, but has, in addition to
the above mark, the word “Chelsea” and the date “1745” upon it. The
mark and the words “Chelsea, 1745,” are graved or scratched in the soft
paste before firing, and, of course, under the glazing (Fig. <a href="#image193c">379</a>). This
mark is particularly interesting and curious, as being the earliest
<i>dated</i> example of English porcelain known. This example, and the
occurrence of the triangle with the name of Chelsea, was first noticed
by me in my history of the Chelsea works in the <i>Art-Journal</i> of
1863.</p>

  </div>

<p>Fig. <a href="#image193e">380</a> is an engraving of an elegant little scent-bottle, formerly in
my own collection, which bears the embossed anchor. The bottle has a
continuous landscape running around it, which is beautifully pencilled,
and is evidently of early work. The plain anchor, drawn in red
<img src="images/image193d.jpg" alt=""
style="height:2em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">
, I have copied from a leaf-shaped dessert dish of early
workmanship. The dish is beautifully painted in small groups and sprigs
of flowers, thrown indiscriminately on the surface, and intermixed with
well-painted insects. The form of the anchor varied, as is natural
to be supposed, according to the idea of the workman, and it was
occasionally drawn with the cable attached. Figs. <a href="#image">382 to 389</a> exhibit
some of the varieties; they are drawn in different colours, red, blue,
and brown, and in gold.</p>

<p>Two anchors, side by side, occasionally occur. Fig. <a href="#image194a">381</a> is from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span> a
small vase in the Museum of Practical Geology, Jermyn Street. The vase
is of deep blue colour, with peacocks, and is painted in compartments
and richly gilt. An anchor and a sword, or an anchor and two swords,
are not unusual marks, and Fig. <a href="#image194d">391</a> is an elegant vase, with open-work
rim, on which it occurs. The raised flowers are beautiful in their
modelling, and the colouring is extremely good. Between the flowers,
leaves, &amp;c., are painted on the vase, which is also decorated with
butterflies, caterpillars, and other insects. On either side is a
cherub’s head, surrounded by raised flowers. The mark on this vase
engraved (Fig. <a href="#image195a">392</a>) is the usual anchor, preceded by a dagger, in red.
It is worthy of remark that on the inside of the cover of the centre
vase—a globular cover surmounted by a bird, and covered with raised
flowers of similar character to those on the vase here given—the mark
is reversed, the anchor preceding the dagger.</p>

<p>A singular mark (Fig. <a href="#image195a">394</a>), communicated to me by Mr. Octavius Morgan,
M.P., occurring on some small groups of figures belonging to Lady Mary
Long, is an anchor, with cable, in red; on one side is an upright
dagger, point upwards, in red; while on the other is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span> horizontal
dagger, point outwards, in <i>blue</i>. This mark occurs on each piece.
Another mark is the anchor with cable, and dagger sometimes on its
right, and at others on its left side. It has been surmised that the
cabled anchor and dagger, or sword, may be Bow; but there is no reason
for supposing this to be the case, and I am inclined to believe they
are really what I have named them—Chelsea. In reference to this remark
I give the following marks, which are considered by Mrs. Palliser
to belong to Bow; but of course there is no proof either way. Those
collectors whose affections mainly centre in Chelsea ascribe pieces
having these marks to that locality, while those whose loves direct
them to the attractions of Bow, with equally as little hesitation
pronounce them to belong to those works. It seems in fact to be, in the
instance of these marks, that the collector has to act on the showman’s
advice—he “pays his money” for the rare piece of china and “takes his
choice” whether he appropriates it to Chelsea or to Bow! I am disposed
to think the anchor really is, as has always been considered, the true
Chelsea mark, and that most of the varieties belong to those works, but
that it was also used by other manufacturers, either separately or in
combination with other devices.</p>

<p>It would leave my notice of the marks of the Chelsea works incomplete,
were I not to introduce the mark which was, for a time, used to denote
the fusion of these works into those of Derby. When Mr. Duesbury
purchased the Chelsea works, and carried on the two together, he added
the letter D to the Chelsea anchor (Fig. <a href="#image195c">403</a>): and this is the mark
which denotes what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span> is known to collectors as “Chelsea Derby” or “Derby
Chelsea” ware, and which, being of comparative rarity, is eagerly
sought after.</p>

<p>It may be well, perhaps, to notice a curious mark which I have
described in my account of “Salopian China,” for the purpose of
suggesting that it <i>may</i> have been engraved for marking on
porcelain made at Caughley, and intended to pass as “Chelsea Derby.”
This mark I reproduce. It occurs on a copper plate (for a mug), and
represents a landscape—a river, with swans sailing, trees on either
side, boat with fishermen, sailing boat, &amp;c.; and in the background a
bridge, a church with ruins to the left, and a tall, gabled building,
over which are the words “Sutton Hall” to the right, above which are
the words “English Hospitality.” It is also well to hint that all china
bearing the well-known red or golden anchor must not be taken to be
Chelsea, for examples which are undoubtedly the production of other
works are constantly occurring.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Second China Works.</i>—Another small china manufactory was
commenced, according to Lysons, at an old mansion by the water side.
This would probably be the works started by a party of workmen from
Staffordshire, thus spoken of by Shaw:—“Carlos Simpson was born at
Chelsea, to which place his father, Aaron Simpson, went in 1747 along
with Thomas Lawton, slip maker; Samuel Parr, turner; Richard Meir,
fire-man; and John Astbury, painter, all of Hot Lane; Carlos Wedgwood,
of the Stocks, a good thrower; Thomas Ward, and several others, from
Burslem, to work at the Chelsea manufactory. They soon ascertained
that they were the principal workmen, on whose exertions all the
excellence of the porcelain must depend; they then resolved to commence
business on their own account at Chelsea, and were in some degree
successful; but at length, owing to some disagreement among themselves,
they abandoned it and returned to Burslem.” The fact may be as Shaw
stated it, so far as regards the workmen going to Chelsea, for some
reason leaving it again and commencing for themselves; but his remark
as to their being “the principal workmen on whose exertions all the
excellence of the porcelain must depend” is sheer nonsense, as at that
time (1747) the Staffordshire workmen did not make porcelain at all.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Wedgwood’s Chelsea Works.</i>—In 1769 or 1770 Josiah Wedgwood
established a branch of his manufactory at Chelsea. This was for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span> the
decoration of his vases by his “peculiar species of encaustic painting
in various colours, in imitation of the ancient Etruscan and Roman
earthenware.” The reason for the founding of this branch was that it
was judged better to have this peculiar style of ornamentation carried
on near London, where suitable artists could easily be got together,
and where the operations could be conducted under the personal
superintendence of Mr. Bentley, who there resided, and for whom in
1769 a house was taken at Chelsea. The partnership between Wedgwood
and Bentley had reference only to the <i>ornamented</i>, not to the
<i>useful</i> ware; but both kinds were decorated at Chelsea, the
two being kept separate in the accounts. The workmen at Chelsea were
thus employed on both branches, the amounts paid them in wages being
distinguished as on “Josiah Wedgwood’s account” and as on “Wedgwood
and Bentley’s account.” Thus, for instance, in the following document,
John Lawrence, for the week ending October 6th, is paid for six days’
work, at 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> a day, of which 5<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> is
charged to “J. W.,” and the other 5<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> to “W. &amp; B.” I
am enabled, from the following document in my possession, to show the
names of a portion, at all events, of the artists who were employed
there in the month of October, 1770. The document is very fragmentary
and imperfect, but, so far as remains, is as follows. The year 1770, it
must be borne in mind, was the very year when the Chelsea China Works
finally passed by purchase into the hands of Duesbury, the owner of the
Derby China Works:—</p>

<p>How long the establishment at Chelsea was continued, I do not know;
but painting was done in London for Wedgwood to a late date. A letter,
dated February 27th, 1795—the month following Josiah Wedgwood’s
death—while speaking of painters and enamellers on porcelain, says,
“I believe Wedgwood’s men here do not get less than 26s. or 28s. per
week,” and the presumption is that these men might be employed at his
Chelsea establishment.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Chelsea Pottery.</i>—About 1774 a pottery was established in Upper
Cheyne Row, Chelsea, for the manufacture of crucibles and melting pots.
It was established by a person named Ruhl, or Ruelle, who was succeeded
by his son-in-law, C. F. Hempel. It had the reputation of producing the
best made crucibles in this country. After the death of Mr. Hempel,
his widow, Johanna Hempel, on the expiration of the lease, removed
the works from Cheyne Row to the King’s Road, where she not only made
crucibles, but table services, being patronised by Queen Charlotte. In
1790 she took out a patent for “a certain composition made of earth and
other materials, and the means of manufacturing the same into basins
and other vessels, which, so manufactured, hath the power of filtering
water and other liquids in a more cheap, easy, and convenient manner
than water or other liquids could then be filtered.” In 1797 Mrs.
Hempel became bankrupt, and the plant and stock-in-trade, including
table services, vases, crucibles, stoves, &amp;c., and a carved sign of
the Queen’s Arms, were sold by auction. The manufactory was afterwards
carried on by Messrs. Ludwig and Warner.</p>

<p>Near this pottery, in 1795, was a manufactory of artificial stone,
carried on by a Mr. Triquet.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Bow.</h3>

<p>Nothing is known definitely as to the date of the first establishment
of this very important china manufactory situated at Stratford-le-Bow.
It must, however, have been in existence some little time prior
to 1744, for in that year it was carried on by “Edward Heylyn, in
the parish of Bow, in the county of Middlesex, merchant,” who, in
conjunction with “Thomas Frye, of the parish of West Ham, in the
county of Essex, painter,” took out a patent for “a new method of
manufacturing a certain material, whereby a ware might be made of the
same nature or kind, and equal to, if not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span> exceeding in goodness and
beauty, china or porcelain ware imported from abroad.” The patent,
which was for fourteen years, bore date the 6th of December, 1744,
and the specification was duly enrolled on the 5th of April, 1745.
This specification I have printed in full on page 112, and it will be
found of the highest interest and totally different from what is put
forth by Chaffers as a copy of it. On the 17th of November, 1748, the
same “Thomas Frye, of the parish of West Ham, in the county of Essex,
painter,” took out another patent, by which he “lawfully might make,
use, exercise, and vend my new method of making a certain ware, which
is not inferior in beauty and fineness, and is rather superior in
strength, than the earthenware that is brought from the East Indies,
and is commonly known by the name of China, Japan, or Porcelain ware.”
The specification was duly enrolled on the 17th of March, 1749, and is
highly interesting. This will be found printed entire on page 113.</p>

     <p class="p0 center sm">Fig. 405.—Inkstand in possession of Mr. R. W. Binns.</p>
  </div>

<p>There is nothing, it will be seen, in these patents or specifications
to show that the works at Bow were carried on by Heylin and
Frye—the one being simply described as of the “parish of Bow,
<i>merchant</i>” (not potter), and the other “of the parish of West
Ham, <i>painter</i>;” nor has anything yet been found, to my knowledge,
to prove that they were actual proprietors of the manufactory. Indeed,
Frye is stated, in more than one work, to have been engaged to
<i>superintend</i> the manufactory. He was an artist of considerable
skill, who is said to have come to London in 1738, and soon afterwards
to have painted a portrait of Frederick, Prince of Wales, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span> the
Saddlers’ Company. He was also a mezzo-tint engraver of considerable
note. To his skill as an artist no doubt he was in the main indebted
for the position he held at Bow; and here it would appear he remained
some fifteen years, to the great injury of his health, and then
returned to his previous occupation; he died in 1763. His daughters are
stated to have assisted him in the painting of china at Bow.</p>

<p>In 1750 the works appear, from the original account-books in the
possession of Lady Charlotte Schrieber, to have come into the hands of
Messrs. Weatherby and Crowther, who, I may add, were potters at St.
Catherine’s, near the Tower. At this time the manufactory was evidently
called “New Canton,” by which name it continued to be known for some
years. It was thus named because, as Thomas Craft wrote in 1790, “the
model of the building was taken from that at Canton in China.” With
reference to this name of “New Canton” a remarkably curious and very
interesting example is in existence, and belongs to my friend, Mr.
Binns F.S.A. It is an inkstand of flat circular form, and is decorated
in blue with flowers, etc. On the top it bears the words, “<span class="allsmcap">MADE
AT NEW CANTON, 1750</span>.” In the centre of the well for the ink,
and around it, are five pen-holes. It is shown on the accompanying
engraving (Fig. <a href="#image199">405</a>). The date, 1750, would show that it was made in
the year when the works first passed, as is supposed, into the hands
of Crowther and Weatherby. Another similar inkstand, deposited in the
Museum of Practical Geology by Mr. Brooks, is dated one year later, its
inscription being, “<span class="allsmcap">MADE AT NEW CANTON, 1751</span>.”</p>

<p>On the 7th of February, 1753, the Bow manufactory opened a wholesale
and retail warehouse in Cornhill, London; as shown in the following
advertisement which I copy from the <i>Derby Mercury</i> of Friday,
March 9th, in that year:—</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center p1">“BOW CHINA WAREHOUSE</p>

<p>“Was opened on <i>Wednesday</i>, the 7th of <i>February</i>,
near the <i>Royal Exchange</i>, in <i>Cornhill,
London</i>, with a Back Door facing the <i>Bank</i>, in
<i>Threadneedle-street</i>, for the convenience of all
Customers, both in Town and Country; where it will continue to
be sold in the same manner as formerly, at <i>BOW</i>, with
Allowance made to Wholesale dealers.”</p>
</div>

<p>In November of the same year an advertisement for painters appeared in
<i>Aris’s Birmingham Gazette</i>, as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This is to give notice to all painters in the blue and white
potting way and enamellers on china ware, that by applying, at
the counting house at the China-house, near Bow, they may meet
with employment and proper encouragement according to their
merit; likewise painters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span> brought up in the snuff-box way,
japanning, fan painting, &amp;c., may have an opportunity of trial,
wherein if they succeed they shall have due encouragement.
N.B.—At the same house a person is wanted who can model small
figures in clay neatly.”</p>
</div>

<p>In 1760, among the many clever artists employed was one Thomas Craft,
who has left a most interesting souvenir of his connection with these
works in the shape of a fine punch-bowl, measuring nearly nine inches
in diameter, which is accompanied by the following note in his own
handwriting:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This Bowl was made at the Bow China Manufactory at
Stratford-le-Bow, Essex, about the year 1760, and painted there
by me, Thomas Craft: my cipher is in the bottom. It is painted
in what we used to call the old Japan taste, a taste at that
time much esteemed by the then Duke of Argyle; there is nearly
two pennyweight of gold—about 15 shillings; I had it in hand,
at different times, about three months; about two weeks’ time
was bestowd upon it; it could not have been manufactured,
&amp;c., for less than £4. There is not its similitude. I took
it in a box to Kentish Town, and had it burned there in Mr.
Gyles’s kiln,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> cost me 3s; it was cracked the first time of
using it. Miss Nancy Sha, a daughter of the late Sir Patrick
Blake,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> was christened with it. I never used it but in
particular respect to my company, and I desire my legatee
(as mentioned in my will) may do the same. Perhaps it may
be thought I have said too much about this trifling toy; a
reflection steals in upon my mind, that this said bowl may meet
with the same fate that the manufactory where it was made has
done, and like the famous cities of Troy, Carthage, &amp;c., and
similar to Shakespear’s Cloud Cap’t Towers, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“The above manufactory was carried on many years under the
firm of Messrs. Crowther and Weatherby, whose names were known
almost over the world; they employed 300 persons; about 90
Painters (of whom I was one), and about 200 turners; throwers,
&amp;c., were employed under one roof. The model of the building
was taken from that at Canton in China; the whole was heated by
two stoves on the outside of the building, and conveyed through
flues or pipes and warmed the whole, sometimes to an intense
heat, unbearable in winter. It now wears a miserable aspect,
being a manufactory for turpentine and small tenements, and
like Shakespeare’s baseless fabric, &amp;c. Mr. Weatherby has been
dead many years; Mr. Crowther is in Morden College, Blackheath,
and I am the only Person of all those employed there who
annually visit him.</p>

<p class="r2 p-min"><span class="smcap">T. Craft</span>, 1790.”</p>
</div>

<p>And the allusion to the works, a little later on—perhaps about
1780—will be found in “Nollekins and his Times,” as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Nollekins</i> (to Betew, a dealer in curiosities in Old
Compton Street). Do you still buy broken silver? I have some
odd sleeve buttons, and Mrs. Nollekins wants to get rid of a
chased watch-case by old Moser, one that he made when he used
to model for the Bow manufactory.</p>

<p>“<i>Betew.</i> Ay, I know there were many very clever things
produced there; what curious heads for canes they made at
that manufactory; I think Crowther was the proprietor’s name.
He has a very beautiful daughter who is married to Sir James
Lake.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Nat Hone painted a portrait of her in the character
of Diana, and it was one of his best pictures. There were some
clever men who modelled for the Bow concern, and they produced
several spirited figures—Quin in Falstaff; Garrick in Richard;
Frederick Duke of Cumberland striding triumphantly over the
Pretender, who is begging quarter of him; John Wilkes, and so
forth.</p>

<p>“<i>Nollekins.</i> Mr. Moser, who was keeper of our Academy,
modelled several things for them; he was a chaser originally.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span></p>

<p>It will be perceived that Betew and Nollekins both speak of the Bow
works as a thing of the past. And so they were; for in October,
1762, says the <i>London Chronicle</i>, “Mr. Weatherby, one of the
proprietors of the Bow china warehouse in Cornhill, died at his house
on Tower Hill, on the 15th October, 1762;” and, in the following
year, 1763, his partner, “John Crowther, of Cornhill, china-man,” was
gazetted a bankrupt. This bankruptcy, however (which was followed by
that of “Benjamin Weatherby, of St. Catherine’s, merchant,” probably
son of the above), appears only to have had reference to the London
warehouse and business, and not to the manufactory at Bow. The stock
was sold by auction, by order of the assignees of John Crowther, on
March 12 and following days, and on May 19th and 30th, the two first
at the Bow warehouse in Cornhill, and the last at the great exhibition
room in Spring Gardens, and consisting, among other things, of “curious
figures,” “girandoles,” “branches for chimney-pieces finely decorated
with figures and flowers,” “dishes,” “compotiers,” “beautiful desserts
of the fine old partridge and wheatsheaf patterns,” “knife and fork
handles,” &amp;c. John Crowther, however, it seems, retained and still, in
his own name alone, carried on the manufactory at Bow, and after a time
opened a warehouse in St. Paul’s Churchyard, which he continued to hold
from 1770 to 1775, when he sold his entire concern—the works, moulds,
tools, &amp;c.—to Mr. William Duesbury, the proprietor of the Derby China
Works.</p>

<p>Mr. Duesbury, who not only held the Derby China Works, but had
purchased those of Chelsea, Giles’s, and one at Vauxhall, thus became
proprietor of the Bow works as well, and was therefore the largest
holder either in those or later days. Mr. Duesbury, as he did with
those of Chelsea, removed the moulds, models, implements, &amp;c., to
Derby, and the Bow manufactory was brought to a close. The next year,
1777, John Crowther became an inmate of Morden College, Blackheath,
being elected on the foundation on the 17th of March, and here he was
still residing in 1790, “and,” says Thomas Craft, “I am the only person
of all those employed there (at Bow) who annually visit him.” On the
site of the works some small tenements and a turpentine manufactory
soon sprang up, and their exact site was forgotten, having been later
on converted into chemical works by Mr. Macmurdo, the calico printer.
Afterwards a portion of the place was used as emery mills by Mr.
Marshall, and, since then, as a manufactory of lucifer matches, vesta
lights, &amp;c.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span> by Messrs. Bell and Black. In 1867, during some sewering
operations at these works, a considerable number of fragments of Bow
china—probably on the site of one of the old kilns—was discovered. Of
this discovery the following interesting account appeared in the <i>Art
Journal</i> for 1869:—</p>

<p>“In trenching a drain from the manufactory into the sewer, the workmen,
at about eight or ten feet from the surface, came upon the débris of
the old Bow China Works.</p>

<p>“Mr. Higgins, jun., who is attached to the match-manufactory, received
his first intimation of the <i>trouvaille</i> from perceiving fragments
of delicate biscuit china in the hands of some children, who had picked
them up as playthings. This led him to keep strict watch over the
excavation, and, by permission of the proprietors, the ground remained
open for a few months, and, as leisure permitted, he examined the earth
for some distance immediately round the spot. Limited as the space
was, he found a great quantity of specimens, which he and his sister,
Miss Higgins, have taken the pains to arrange carefully in trays, and
through their kindness we are enabled to describe some of the more
interesting examples.</p>

<p>“Although fragmentary, they are particularly interesting, as showing us
the various descriptions of ware made at Bow, verifying its products,
and enabling us to identify not only the paste and glaze, but the
methods of ornamentation.</p>

<p>“The spot where the excavations were made is supposed to have been
where one of the kilns formerly stood; this is borne out to a certain
extent by the presence of a quantity of bricks cemented together, the
inner surface having become vitrified by the heat of the kiln; and also
by a vast number of broken saggers, or cases of baked earthenware,
used to contain the china, and protect it from the flame and ashes
in the kiln. One of these saggers, of cylindrical form, measures 10
inches in diameter by 8½ inches in height; it had three rows of holes
pierced through the sides, at equal distances from top to bottom, into
which clay pegs (like large clout nails) were inserted, to support the
circular platforms within, at convenient distances, on which the china
articles rested while baking. The cockspur, or point, used to separate
the china is a simple cone of baked clay, not the usual form, which
is like the <i>caltrop</i>, having always three points below and one
only uppermost. Large pieces of china clay were found, some in a soft,
soapy state, others hardened; bones of animals, which entered into
the composition of the paste, as well as calcined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span> flints and pieces
of quartz, used in making the frit or glaze; a number of circular
medallions of baked clay, from two to six inches in diameter—one was
marked on each side with H and M cut into the clay. All the fragments
of vessels discovered are of porcelain biscuit: not a piece of Delft or
common earthenware was found among them: some few are glazed, but these
form the exceptions.</p>

<p>“The first we shall notice, and probably the earliest manufacture, are
the pieces decorated with blue painting: the designs are painted, in
mineral colour, on the biscuit, and have not been glazed or burnt in.
These designs are principally of Chinese landscapes, flowers, figures,
and birds. A few examples are given on the next page, to show their
general character.</p>

<p>“A very frequent pattern of simple character in the blue ware is three
hanging branches of willow leaves. Among the rest is a mottled ground
plate with white angular medallions of light blue scenery. The only
variations in colour are a cup with green leaves and lake flowers,
and a fragment painted in lake <i>camaïeu</i>, with a castellated
mansion, of high finish: these two are glazed. Not a single specimen of
blue-<i>printed</i> china was discovered: all are <i>painted</i> with
a brush. This is not at all surprising, for it must be remembered they
are all unfinished pieces, which have never been out of the factory;
and, when this decoration was required, they were sent to Liverpool to
be printed.</p>

<p>“The next division consists of biscuit china, fragments of services
ornamented in relief, the favourite pattern being the Mayflower. The
hawthorn is represented quite after nature, with its thorny branches
and blossom. About a dozen of the moulds for stamping these flowers
were also found quite perfect; they are of biscuit, three inches by two
and a half in diameter. Fig. <a href="#image205">408</a> is interesting, being the original
mould of a biscuit cup which has its exact counterpart glazed. These
pieces form a history in themselves.</p>

<p>“Another mould is of two roses and leaves on a stalk (Fig. <a href="#image205">409</a>). The
raised figures on the biscuit are remarkably sharp; but the application
of the glaze fills up the spaces.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image205">

    class="p1"   
    src="images/image205.jpg"
     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center sm">Figs. 406 to 415.</p>
  </div>

<p>“The other decorations in relief are the basket pattern, overlapping
leaves, vertical bands overlaid with scrolls, ribbed cups and
basins, a biscuit candlestick in form of a vine-leaf, another of
different pattern painted blue. In this extensive collection we
find milk-pots, cups, cans, and saucers, open-work baskets, octagon
plates, cup-handles, lion’s-paw feet, small pots for colour or rouge;
but not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span> a single piece has any mark which can be assigned to the
<i>fabrique</i>. One of the cups has the name of ‘Norman’ written on it
in pencil—perhaps the name of one of the painters. Among other relics
are pieces which have been injured in the kiln by falling into ugly and
distorted shapes, plates and saucers that have inadvertently gone in
contact with each other and could not be separated.</p>

<p>“There is a great variety of china biscuit knife-handles, some plain,
others with rococo scrolls in relief, heightened with blue; two
specimens are here given (Figs. <a href="#image205">414 and 415</a>).</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image206a">

    src="images/image206a.jpg"
     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center sm">Fig. 416.</p>
  </div>

<p>“Some few pieces of an ornamental character are among the débris. The
foot of a salt-cellar beautifully modelled in biscuit, formed of three
shells, with smaller shells and seaweed between; the upper shell, to
hold the salt, is wanting. A sketch of it is here given (Fig. <a href="#image205">413</a>).
To these may be added the foot of a large centre ornament of the same
character as the last, to hold sweetmeats, also modelled by hand in
shells of all sorts, rock-work, coral, seaweed, &amp;c., with three escalop
shells: this has had one or more tiers above, but broken off at stem.
Some natural shells were found which served as copies. There are two
pug-dogs nearly perfect, with collars, on which are roses. Two handles,
in form of female heads, in high relief, for tureens and other large
bowls (Fig. <a href="#image206a">416</a>); and a man’s head, with a high cap and feather, nicely
modelled (Fig. <a href="#image206b">417</a>); also the body of a female figure in biscuit, with
laced bodice.</p>

<p>“The Bow paste is exceedingly hard, and the fracture very close and
compact; consequently the pieces, as a rule, are very heavy for
their size, but many of the cups and saucers are almost of egg-shell
thickness. The colour is a milky white.”</p>

<p>In the <i>Art-Journal</i> for 1869 a notice of the account-books of the
Bow works, now belonging to Lady Charlotte Schrieber, is given; and
this I here quote, as it contains some highly interesting matter:—</p>

<p>“The first contains the accounts from January, 1750.—1. O.S.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
in which year the partnership of Messrs. Crowther and Weatherby
commenced, up to December, 1755. From these it appears that a branch
establishment was opened in London in 1753, which, no doubt, was that
of St. Catherine’s, near the Tower,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> although the place is not
mentioned. An account is given in separate columns of the value of the
<i>bisket</i> and <i>glazed-ware</i> taken into the warehouse at Bow,
and sold out of the warehouses at London and Bow, in each year.</p>

<p>“A statement for the year 1754 is here given, to show the extent of the
business transacted.</p>

<p>“There is a cash-account book for 1757 and 1758, of receipts and
payments of a London branch of the Bow factory, either at St.
Catherine’s or in Cornhill: it is balanced weekly. The moneys received
are principally from customers, whose names are given, and ready money
taken daily, cash received from St. James Street, &amp;c., averaging about
£120 per week. The bulk of the money was paid to Mr. Crowther every
week, occasionally to Mr. Weatherby.</p>

<p>“Mr. Frye frequently received sums varying from £15 to £30, possibly
for expenses at Bow; Mr. Heylin’s name occurs once or twice only for
small sums. Other payments are for powder gold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span> and for grain gold
for Bow; freight of clay; weekly wages—to Mr. Brown, 18<i>s.</i>;
Mr. Sandys, 12<i>s.</i>; Hugh Williams, 12<i>s.</i>; Stephenson,
12<i>s.</i>; Burnett, 10<i>s.</i>,—which average about 60<i>s.</i> per
week.</p>

<p>“The book we now refer to contains memoranda made by John Bowcocke, in
1756; he was one of the managers, or perhaps traveller, for the Bow
works. In it we find orders from customers, and many interesting notes
relating to the business. We shall have occasion to quote largely from
this manuscript, as the items throw considerable light upon the various
descriptions of ware made there, among which many will be identified by
the curious reader.</p>

<p>“On analyzing these memoranda, although they are but imperfect and
necessarily curt, being written only for the writer’s guidance, we are
made acquainted with many facts not before disclosed; for example—it
has never been suggested that <i>printed</i> china was produced at Bow,
yet it is evident that china was decorated with transfer engravings as
early as the year 1756, as appears from the following entries:—</p>

<p>
“‘One pint <i>printed</i> mug,
One half-pint, do.,
A sett compleat of the second <i>printed</i> teas.’
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span></p>

<p>“The patent which Messrs. Sadler and Green, of Liverpool, proposed
taking out as inventors of the process is dated 1756, but they had
brought the art to perfection several years before, and had kept it a
profound secret. Transfer printing on enamel was in vogue at Battersea
before 1755, and the process would be the same on china as enamel.
Horace Walpole, writing to Richard Bentley in Sept. 1755, says, ‘I send
you a trifling snuff-box, only as a sample of the new manufacture at
Battersea, which is done with copper-plates.’ Mr. Binns, of Worcester,
has a Battersea enamel watch-case with the tea-party from the same
plate as the impressions on china. The <i>Liverpool Guide</i> of 1799
says ‘copper-plate printing upon china and earthenware originated here
in 1752, and remained some time a secret with the inventors, Messrs.
Sadler and Green. The manner in which this continues to be done here,
remains still unrivalled in perfection. As late as 1783, Wedgwood
constantly sent his ware to Liverpool to be printed.’</p>

<p>“The proprietors of the Bow works availed themselves of assistance
by occasionally sending their china to Liverpool to be printed.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
All the pieces decorated with transfer engravings, have, without
discrimination, been erroneously assigned to Worcester, owing to the
want of a thorough investigation of the quality of the body.</p>

<p>“Lady Charlotte Schreiber has a teapot with a transfer portrait of the
‘Prussian Hero,’ the handle and spout ornamented in relief with the
enamelled flowers peculiar to Bow; a bowl with prints of the well-known
tea-party, and garden-scenes; and two plates, part of ‘a sett of the
second <i>printed</i> teas,’ before alluded to, with poultry and
leaves. All these are undoubtedly of Bow body, probably decorated at
Liverpool.</p>

<p>“Large quantities of blue-painted ware issued from the Bow works, and
there are frequent allusions to them in the order-book, for cheap
services. On examining the blue pieces, which can be safely assigned to
Bow from the nature of the body, there is a peculiarity in the glaze
which arises in this way: blue being at that time the only colour
that would bear the intense heat of the kiln (<i>au grand feu</i>),
it is always painted on the biscuit before being dipped in the glaze;
consequently portions, however slight, are apt, while the glaze is in
a fluid state, to spread over the surface, giving it a blue tinge,
especially on large surfaces; the other colours, as well as the
gold, are painted <i>over the glaze</i>, and set in a kiln of lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
temperature, called the reverberatory or muffle kiln. Hence the blue,
being <i>under the glaze</i>, is imperishable, but the other colours,
from frequent use, get rubbed off.</p>

<p>“We find in the order-book the blue Newark pattern; blue dolphin
pickle-stand; ‘setts of blue teas.’ A dinner-service was ordered to be
‘blue and pale as you please,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>“Among the patterns noticed in the same book are white bud sprigs,
sprigged tea sets, and Dresden sprigs; partridge services, imaged
services, and dragon services, were in great demand; Chelsea cabbage
leaf, the lady pattern, and the Princess of Wales’s pattern, white men
with salt boxes, mugs painted to the fine landscape pattern, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“Of the figures and groups, only a few are mentioned, such as
Minerva of two sizes, Flora, imperial shepherd and shepherdess, the
new shepherd and its companion, Cupid, gentleman and lady, boy and
girl, fluter, fiddler, harlequin, columbine, and pierrot or clown,
tambourine-player, sportsman, cook, Dutch dancer, woman with chicken,
Turk and companion, female figure, birds on pedestals, swans, boars,
squirrels, buck and doe, goat, and toys of all sorts.</p>

<p>“These short notices of Bow figures, although far from being important
examples, will remind many of our readers of similar pieces which have
been classed as Chelsea.</p>

<p>“We may also refer to the pair of white china figures of Woodward the
actor, and Mrs. Clive, in the costumes as given in Bell’s ‘Collection
of Plays.’ A pair of these in the white Bow china, exquisitely modelled
and finished, bear the date 1758 stamped in the clay: they are in the
possession of a lady whose family has retained them ever since they
came from the factory.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Memorandum-book of John Bowcocke for 1758.</p>

<p>“There is very little to interest us in this book. Bowcocke was at
Dublin for the first eight months, receiving consignments of glass and
china from the works, which were sold principally by auction. The money
taken was remitted weekly to the company.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘<i>Feb. 9, 1758.</i> Dublin. I went to see Sheridan, in
Hamlet.</p>

<p><i>April 19.</i> Lady Freik shew’d me two tureens she brought
from France, moulded from a full-grown cabbage. (A sketch is
given.)</p>

<p><i>Aug. 22.</i> At Nottingham. Called on Mr. Rigley; he says he
was used ill about some figure Thorpe sent, not to order, and
has done.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 24.</i> At Bow. Went to hear Mr. John Crowther preach
his first sermon.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 16.</i> Bought a china figure for Mrs. McNally,
4<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Painting do., 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Treating Mrs. McNally, wine, 1<i>s.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span></p>

<p>Went to see her home from the play, 1<i>s.</i>; purl, 2<i>d.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(This lady was a good customer of the firm: on
referring to the cash-book, we find she paid, on Oct.
16th, £18 13<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><i>Nov. 27.</i> At Bow. Observed in the burning of the bisquit
ware that dishes and plates should be burnt in new cases, and
only one in each case, as when two are burnt in one another it
is certain that one is always bad.</p>

<p>All handled chocolates and coffees and handled teas to be burnt
with covers.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 26.</i> Dined with Mr. H. Frye and family at Stratford.’</p>
</div>

<p>“In the front of this book is a note in pencil, written in 1866,
stating that—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘One hundred years since, John Bowcocke died, Tuesday, Feb.
26th, 1765, at 6 o’clock in the evening, of lockjaw. He was
brother to William Bowcocke, of Chester, painter, my mother’s
father.—<span class="smcap">Thos. Bailey.</span>’</p>
</div>

<p>“In the same collection are two books of pencil sketches by a French
artist named De la Cour, of plants, trees, festoons of flowers, rococo
scrolls, cane handles, frames, chimney-pieces, landscapes (among which
is a view of London), figures, single figures for statuettes, &amp;c.
Another book contains coloured engravings by Martin Engelbrecht, of
Nuremberg, of a great variety of subjects suitable for painting on
china: costumes of various nations, ladies and gentlemen splendidly
attired, shepherds and shepherdesses, garden scenes and summer-houses,
palaces, birds, animals and insects, hunting scenes, musicians, Chinese
figures and scenery, interlaced ornaments, &amp;c. A fourth book, published
by Edwards and Darley, 1754, consists of engraved subjects,—Chinese
interiors, vases, figures, pagodas, bridges, animals, exotic birds,
insects, &amp;c. The Chinese designs are mixed up with <i>rococo</i>
scrolls and other ornamental work.”</p>

<p>Enough will have been gleaned from the foregoing regarding the various
productions of the Bow Works. One or two noted examples, however,
require to be specially named, as being usually associated in the minds
of collectors with this manufactory. One of these is a well-known small
goat milk-jug which was formerly always attributed to Bow. It bears a
bee in relief under the spout which was supposed to be allegorical of
the initial B of Bow. Some examples, however, are without the bee. They
are occasionally marked with a simple triangle, which, however, has
been shown to have been occasionally used at Chelsea; and that the goat
jugs were also there made.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The marks attributed to the Bow factory are numerous and varied;
and some which are so ascribed have not, I believe, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span> slightest
connection with those works. The following are among the marks, said
by one writer or other to belong to Bow, but some of them are very
doubtful. Indeed, there is almost an absolute certainty that some of
those ascribed to Bow, in reality belong to Chelsea and other places.
Some of these marks are incised.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Stratford.</h3>

<p>The <i>London Chronicle</i> of 1755 contains the following paragraph:
“Yesterday four persons, well skilled in the making of British china,
were engaged for Scotland, where a new porcelain manufacture is going
to be established in the manner of that now carried on at Chelsea,
Stratford, and Bow.” From this it is evident that in 1755 a china
manufactory, distinct from that at Bow, was carried on at this place.
Nothing, however, is at present known as to its history.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Kentish Town.</h3>

<p>In the middle of last century John Giles had a small establishment
and kiln at Kentish Town, where he finished and burned china, &amp;c.,
procured in the white from other manufactories. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span> advertised “to
procure and paint, for any person, Worcester porcelain to any or in any
pattern;” and here vases and other articles, decorated by himself and
by other artists and amateurs, were burned. An interesting reference
to this kiln will be found in my account of the Bow china works on
another page, where Thomas Craft, speaking of a bowl he had made,
writing from memory in 1790, says “about the year 1760:” “I took it in
a box to Kentish Town, and had it burned there in Mr. Gyles’s kiln,
cost me 3<i>s.</i>” In 1771 Giles took premises in Cockspur Street,
as a sale-room, &amp;c. On the 9th of July in that year the lease of
these premises was granted from “George Stubbs, of the parish of St.
Margaret, Westmr., in the county of Middx., Esq.,“ to James Giles, of
the parish of St. James, within the liberty of Westmr., in the said
county of Middlx., china-man,” of “all that messuage or tenement and
premises, lately called or known by the name of the Gun Tavern, in
the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, in the said county of Middx.,
situate and being on the north side of a street called Cockspur Street,
leading from Pall Mall to Charing Cross, and lately in the tenure or
occupation of Susannah Cannon, deceased, together with all ways,”
&amp;c., &amp;c., for a term of 21 years, at an annual rental of £110. These
premises were held from the Crown, on a longer lease, by Stubbs, so
that this was a sub-letting to Giles, who had power to enter upon them
on the above date, but to be free from rent until September 29th in
consideration of any sums he might lay out in repairs, he covenanting
to lay out in improvements and repairs £300, if requisite. The deed, in
my own possession, bears the signature and seal of “Geo. Stubbs,” and
the attesting signatures of “G. Stubbs. Jos. Mead, his Clerk.”</p>

<p>Giles appears to have become involved soon after this, and was assisted
with loans and money and in other ways, by Duesbury, of the Derby china
works. This is proved by papers in my own possession, amongst which are
several notes of hand, as “Borrowed of Mr. Duesbury five guineas, which
I promise to repay on demand. James Giles.” “Paid Mr. Heath a Bill on
Mr. Giles, dated Feb. 20, at two months, value £120.” “April 1, James
Giles’s note due 4th June, 1777, £50.” “May 29, Jas. Giles’s note due
July 12, £50,” etc., etc. Ultimately Mr. Duesbury, on the failure of
Giles, took to his stock and entire concern, and the original accounts,
&amp;c., connected with this are in my own possession. One of these, the
balance-sheet of the estate for 1776–77, is very curious as showing
some of the fashionable people with whom he did business:—</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Euston Road.</h3>

<p>In 1860 Messrs. W. and T. Wills, sculptors, having turned their
attention to the production of works of art in terra-cotta, commenced
the manufacture at this place. The works produced consist of vases,
figures and groups of figures, busts, &amp;c., of a size and character for
drawing-room use. The subjects are principally mythological, and are
admirably modelled—each piece sent out receiving its finishing touches
from the artist’s own hands. In colour, Messrs. Wills’ terra-cottas are
a delicate pink and deep rich red. Their names are marked on each piece.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Oxford Street.</h3>

<p>Among London establishments who, from a long and intimate connection
with some of the more eminent of our porcelain works, may almost be
considered to be manufacturers, are the following. To these firms
the world owes many of the most striking and beautiful of ceramic
productions. These have been designed by the firms themselves, and made
specially for them; they thus become literally their own productions.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Mortlocks</i>; Oxford Street.—This house was established in 1746,
by John Mortlock, and has been uninterruptedly continued since that
date through five generations, in direct line, of the same family;
its head at the present time being, as it was more than one hundred
and fifty years ago, a John Mortlock. In the palmy days of the old
Rockingham works, John Mortlock was London agent for the goods made
there. One speciality of these works, the “Cadogan” teapot, formed on
the model of an example of Indian green ware brought from abroad by the
Marquess and Marchioness of Rockingham, or the Hon. Mrs. Cadogan, was
the means of adding largely to his connection with these works. The
first of these was made for the Marchioness of Rockingham; and when
the Prince Regent, afterwards George IV., visited Wentworth House, the
seat of Earl Fitzwilliam, these teapots were then in use, and were much
admired; the prince, who was a great connoisseur in tea, I believe,
bringing one of them away with him. On the return of the prince and
his suite to town, inquiries were made for them of John Mortlock, who
supplied the palace with china, &amp;c. He at once saw that they would come
into great repute, and ordered a large quantity, stipulating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span> that
his name, <span class="allsmcap">MORTLOCK</span>, should be stamped upon them. This was
done in place of the word <span class="allsmcap">ROCKINGHAM</span>, and they thus passed as
Mortlock’s own make; he ordered at one time as much as £900 worth for
one season’s consumption. (See “Rockingham Works.”)</p>

<p>When the Nantgarw works were first started, Mr. Mortlock became a large
purchaser as well as agent. He regularly took a large quantity of the
ware in the white; this he had painted in London, by Webster, Randall,
and various other artists, and fired at the enamel kiln of Messrs.
Robins and Randall, in Spa Fields. At this time Mortlock was also agent
to the Coalport and Swansea works; and Mr. Nore, of Coalport, feeling
a jealousy, and finding that the sale of the Swansea and Nantgarw
productions interfered with his own, bought up those two concerns,
removed their models, &amp;c., to Coalport, and closed them. The firm
still retain an agency for Coalport, and also for Messrs. Minton &amp; Co.
Mr. Mortlock has special marks for some of the Coalport productions
prepared from his designs.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Hoxton.</h3>

<p>In 1693 there was “a famous brick-moulder at Hoxton.” Some very
interesting particulars are given by Houghton, in his “Husbandry and
Trade Improved,” 1693.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Hammersmith.</h3>

<p>Houghton, in 1693, thus alludes to the brick works at this place: “Some
can make fourteen or 15,000 in a day, some 18,000; but <i>Nicholas
Gooding</i>, of <i>Hammersmith</i>, for a wager of 10<i>l.</i>, made in
one day 22,000 bricks, upon which <i>Sir Nicholas Crisp</i> assisted
him to set up, and he is now living at <i>Hammersmith</i>, and worth
several thousand pounds. His master’s name was <i>Gosling</i>, who had
three men whom he often encouraged to wagers.”</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Worcester—The Royal Porcelain Works.</h3>
<p>There are three things for which the “faithful city” of Worcester, so
celebrated in history for its loyalty, is at the present day especially
famous. These are its porcelain, its gloves, and its sauce. For who
has not drunk out of or seen “Worcester china,” worn “Dent’s gloves,”
or tasted “Lea and Perrin’s Worcestershire sauce”? These three are
things which are identified with its name wherever Worcester is heard
of, and, in the minds of some people, take precedence of its glorious
cathedral, its tomb of King John, or its exquisitely beautiful shrine
of Prince Arthur. With the first of these only I have now to do, and
its history is one of great interest, as connected with that of the
general porcelain manufacture of the kingdom.</p>

<p>At a time when foreign china was much sought after, when Fulham,
Chelsea, Bow, and Derby were gradually working their way into favour,
and gaining ground on their foreign rivals in the estimation of
people of taste, Worcester was quietly experimentalising in the
same direction, and gradually paving the way for the establishment
of those works which have since become so great a benefit to it,
and so great an honour to the country. Exactly in the middle of the
last century these experiments were carried on, and the works were
soon afterwards established, and rapidly grew into note. So rapidly,
indeed, did the ware made at this manufactory come into repute, that
in the year following the opening of the works<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span> it was noticed in the
<i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, and in 1763 was alluded to in the “Annual
Register.”</p>

     <p class="p0 center sm">Fig. 451.—Portrait of Dr. Wall.</p>
  </div>

<p>The “faithful city” was indebted for the establishment of its pottery
to the exertions and scientific researches of Dr. John Wall, a
physician of that city. The learned doctor was born at Powick, a
village in Worcestershire, in the year 1708. His father was a tradesman
in Worcester, of which city he served the office of mayor in 1703;
he was descended from a good family in Herefordshire. Dr. Wall’s
father dying while he was young, he was educated at the King’s School,
Worcester, and in 1726 became a scholar at Worcester College, Oxford.
Nine years later, at the age of twenty-seven, he became a fellow of
Merton College. Having studied at Oxford and at St. Thomas’s Hospital,
he in 1739 took his degree, and commenced practice in Worcester. He
married Catherine Sandys, cousin to the first Lord Sandys. Dr. Wall,
besides being a clever practitioner and an excellent chemist, was also
an artist of great ability; he painted historical pictures with great
judgment, and his conceptions were sometimes marked with considerable
originality and grandeur. One of his principal pictures is that of the
founder, &amp;c., in the hall of Merton College, Oxford—a painting<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
he presented to that college in 1765. Of his other works, his “Brutus
condemning his Sons,” “The Head of Pompey brought to Cæsar” (now at
Hagley), “Regulus returning to Carthage,” “Queen Eleanor sucking the
Poison from the Arm of Edward I.,” “Elijah fed by the Ravens,” “Moses
striking the Rock,” “The School of Physic,” “The Shunamite’s Child
restored,” and “The Head of St. John the Baptist,” are among the
best. He also etched some remarkably clever plates,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span> and designed the
stained-glass window in the bishop’s private chapel at Hartlebury, the
“Presentation of Christ in the Temple,” a window at Oriel College,
and others. Dr. Wall was also the author of several medical works,
and was eminently instrumental in bringing the Malvern waters into
public notice. He was also one of the most zealous supporters of the
Worcestershire Infirmary.</p>

<p>Dr. Wall, besides his other accomplishments, was, as has already been
intimated, an excellent practical chemist; his laboratory was at
No. 33, Broad Street. He turned his attention more particularly to
experimentalising on materials which might be used for the manufacture
of porcelain; and in 1751, about a year after the establishment of the
works at Derby, and while those at Chelsea and Bow were being carried
on, he brought his experiments to a successful issue; the result being
the discovery of a body of surpassing excellence.</p>

<p>It has been said, and there is indeed a traditional belief in the
fact, that the mainspring of Dr. Wall’s experiments was a political
one, and that he was induced to turn his attention to the subject in
the hope of introducing into Worcester a new branch of manufacture,
by which “the low party of the county” might be enabled, by the votes
it would command, “to stand a competition for members of parliament
with the ministerial or popular party.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> I cannot, however, for a
moment, and, despite all that has been brought forward on the matter,
believe that this was the motive power by which Dr. Wall, a man of high
intellect and attainments, and of noble character, was impelled to the
prosecution of his inquiries; but that for the good of science and of
commerce alone, and with a knowledge that a branch of manufacture of
the kind, if once well established, must be lucrative to its possessors
and advantageous to the city, he was induced to work hard and zealously
in his laboratory until he had mastered the difficulties which
surrounded him, and had produced a material that should successfully
rival the foreign examples which he took for his model. However, be
this as it may, in the year 1751 success had so far attended his
labours that he formed a company for the manufacture of porcelain in
Worcester, and thus laid the foundation of that manufacture which has
been carried on with uninterrupted success for a century and quarter.</p>

<p>The “Worcester Porcelain Company,” founded, then, in 1751 by Dr. Wall,
consisted of several gentlemen who joined him in his undertaking,
and thus formed a “joint-stock company” for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span> manufacture of the
chinaware on the principle he had discovered. The names of these
proprietors from 1751 to 1772 were Dr. Wall, Richard Holdship, Rev.
Benjamin Blayney, Samuel Bradley, Rev. Samuel Pritchett, Wm. Oliver,
David Henry (in place of Richard Holdship), Wm. Davis, John Salway,
Germain Lavie, Rev. Thomas Vernon, Mary Blayney, Richard Cook,
Henry Cook, and John Thorneloe. The company thus formed commenced
its operations in a fine old mansion, formerly the residence of the
Warmstrey family, in Warmstrey Slip and Palace Row, nearly adjoining
the bishop’s palace; the grounds at the back, at that time beautifully
laid out, running down to the banks of the Severn, and commanding a
delightful view of the valley, and of the Malvern and Abberley hills
beyond.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The mansion of the Warmstrey family,” says a local writer, in
1837, “is conjectured to have been occupied as far back as the
reign of Henry VII. and Henry VIII., by Sir William Windsor,
second Lord Windsor, an ancestor of the late Earl of Plymouth.
On the first floor of the house is a parlour, wainscoted round
with oak, and over the fire-place is a very curious specimen
of armorial ensigns, carved in wood, and bearing the marks of
great age. They are the arms of Sir William Windsor, second
Lord Windsor, the distinguished nobleman just alluded to,
and such as are borne by the Earls of Plymouth. The arms are
quartered as follows:—</p>

<p>“1. Windsor—gules a saltire ar. between twelve cross

<p>“The late Earl of Plymouth, when inspecting the process of the
porcelain works a few years back, with his sister, the late
Marchioness of Downshire, and his father-in-law, Earl Amhurst,
recognised these memorials of his ancestors, and viewed them
for some time with much interest.</p>

<p>“In 1533, reign of Henry VIII., this Sir William Windsor,
second Lord Windsor, was made one of the Knights of the Bath,
against the coronation of Anne Boleyn, which was performed
with great solemnity at Westminster. And at the decease of the
king, he was one of the twelve peers, chief mourners, who,
on August 8th, 1553, attended the funeral. His lordship was
buried at Bredenham, in Buckinghamshire (where the family then
had estates), very splendidly, according to his quality, says
Strype.</p>

<p>“After a lapse of ages, the family of the Plowdens occupied
the mansion for some time; and ultimately this ancient
edifice, about eighty-six years since, was devoted to its
present purposes, and now exhibits an animating scene of art
and industry, rivalling most successfully some of the finest
productions of the Royal Porcelain Works of the Continent.</p>

<p>“A few of the old rooms are preserved in their original state,
and have been much admired by some learned antiquaries, and
others who delight in viewing the relics of past ages. The
house forms a sort of quadrangle, with a court in the centre,
and was formerly the residence of the ‘Warmstreys,’ several
of whom were connected, as registrars and others, with the
Cathedral Church of Worcester. The library of the house is
a lofty and spacious room, wainscoted with oak, carved in
various parts with different devices, and the arms of the
family of ‘Warmstrey,’ viz., a cross molyn between crescents
and decrescents, and impaled and quartered with the arms of
other families. The fire-place is of very ample dimensions,
with handsome pillars on each side, and the chimney-piece is
decorated with a scroll extremely well cut. Surmounting it, the
royal arms of England appear most curiously carved; and around
the room may still be seen the antique book-shelves, edged with
a scolloped border of green cloth, remaining quite firm in its
texture. Adjoining the library, is a small study, fitted up
with book-shelves in the same style.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span></p>

<p>The family was one of considerable note, and monuments to Mrs. Cecil
Warmstrey, widow of the registrar of the diocese, 1649; to the said
registrar; and to Dr. Thomas Warmstrey, dean of Worcester, their son,
1661, who was a famous divine, and was one of the persons appointed
by the city to treat as to terms of its surrender to the army of the
parliament in 1646—are to be seen in the cathedral. The building
still remains, and is now occupied by Messrs. Dent and Co. for the
manufacture of gloves. The old part of the building has been entirely
denuded of its ornament, and stripped of every vestige of its former
grandeur; the gardens have been covered with engine-houses, scouring
and dyeing rooms, and other buildings necessary to the works now
carried on, and which find employment for many hundreds of people.</p>

<p>Warmstrey House was sold in 1707 by its then owners, the Rev. Chewning
Blackmore and Abigail his wife, for the sum of £340, to William Evett,
glover. On the 16th of May, 1751, the premises were leased by William
Evett, glover, to Richard Holdship the younger, glover, for the term
of twenty-one years, with right of renewal for a further term of
twenty-one years on payment of a fine of £20, the annual rent being £30.</p>

<p>This Richard Holdship was one of the partners in the porcelain
company, and it was, it appears, for the purposes of this company
that he became lessee of the premises. The company at this time, on
its first formation, appears to have consisted of Dr. John Wall, Mr.
Richard Holdship, the Rev. Benjamin Blayney, and Mr. Samuel Bradley, a
goldsmith, who kept the house in High Street for retailing the ware.
To these were subsequently added the others named above. In 1772–4 the
partners were Dr. Wall, the two William Davises, father and son, Rev.
T. Vernon, Robert Hancock the engraver, and Richard Cook of London. In
1774 Hancock left the concern, and from 1776 to 1783 the two Davises
and Vernon were the only proprietors.</p>

<p>The company at first turned its attention principally to the production
of imitations of the Chinese porcelain, both in form and colour. Thus
the blue and white patterns—then so general in Chinese porcelain, and
the characteristic of the Nankin ware—were for a time, it appears,
exclusively followed at Worcester. Some of the brilliant colours of the
Japanese ceramists were, however, soon attempted, and with complete
success; and by the conventional arrangement of these colours in new
patterns the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span> Worcester potters were gradually led on to more elaborate
productions.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image226">

  </div>

<p>The works must have been commenced on a tolerably large scale, and
have rapidly risen in importance, for in 1752—only a year after the
formation of the company—the premises were very business-like in their
arrangement and extensive in their proportions, and were sufficiently
important to be engraved in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> of that
year. Of that view the accompanying engraving is a reduced fac-simile,
and it will show at once how soon the works had risen to a state of
importance. The following explanatory references from the Magazine will
make it better understood:—“Explanation. 1. St. Andrew’s. 2. Warmstrey
Slip. 3. Biscuit kilns. 4. Glazing kilns. 5. Great kiln for segurs. 6.
Pressing and modelling gallery. 7. Rooms for throwing, turning, and
stove-drying the ware on the first floor, <i>a</i>, of the chamber
floors. 8. The garden. 9. The yard for coals. 10. Mr. Evett’s house
and garden, landlord of the premises. <i>b</i>. The eight windows in
two large chambers, in which the ware is placed on stallions, on the
east and north, where are the painters’ rooms. All the beginning of the
process is carried on under the quadrangular building, ground floor,
marked <span class="allsmcap">A</span>; in its N.W. angle is the great rowl and ring; in the
N.E. the horses turn the same, and the levigators near to the rowl. The
next (on the ground floor) is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span> the slip and treading-rooms; behind No.
4 is the glazing-room; behind 5 is the secret-room on the ground-floor.”</p>

<p>Accompanying this engraving, which bears the initials “<i>J. D.
delin.</i>” (probably John Davis, one of the partners) and “J. C.
sculp.” (probably J. Cave), is the following interesting note:—“N.B.
A sale of this manufacture will begin at the <i>Worcester</i>
music-meeting on Sept. 20, with great variety of ware, and, ’tis said,
at a moderate price.”</p>

<p>This was probably the first time the Worcester goods were brought into
the public market. The goods were first vended by Mr. Samuel Bradley,
one of the partners, at a shop opposite the Guildhall in High Street,
and afterwards in larger premises near the Cross.</p>

<p>The characteristic of the early ware was a peculiarly soft greenness
of hue in the body, and by this, as well as the general style of
ornamentation, and by the marks, Worcester specimens may without
difficulty be recognised. The first mark used I believe to have been
a simple letter W., but the marks are so various in the early period
of the manufacture that it is most difficult, indeed impossible, to
arrange them chronologically. Like the D on the Derby porcelain,
which might be either the initial of the founder of the works,
<i>Duesbury</i>, or that of the town, <i>Derby</i>, the Worcester
ware had a W., which might be the initial of <i>its</i> founder,
<i>Wall</i>, or of the city, <i>Worcester</i>, itself. The different
varieties of the letter W which have come under my notice are the
following, and these may certainly all of them be ascribed to an
early period. Another distinctive mark of about the same time is the
crescent, which is sometimes drawn in outline, sometimes filled in
in lines, and sometimes of full blue colour. This mark is supposed
to be taken, and perhaps with some probability, from the arms of
the Warmstreys, which decorated the rooms used by the workmen. It
is worthy of note here, that one of the marks of the Caughley or
Coalport porcelain was also a crescent. As these works are said to have
been established by Worcester workmen, the use of this mark may be
attributed to them, and it may have had the double signification of a
crescent and a C for <i>Caughley</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span></p>

<p>As the Worcester aim was to copy, and emulate in design and material,
the ceramic productions of China and Japan,—indeed, there were
scarcely any others to copy from at this early period,—so it appears
to have been the study of the artists to copy, or to simulate, the
marks used on the productions of these foreign manufactories; and thus
a great variety of marks are to be met with principally, or, I may say,
entirely, drawn in blue. Some of the most characteristic and general of
these I here append.</p>

  </div>

<p>A considerable variety of other marks are to be met with, but I
apprehend they are most probably but the distinctive marks of the
artists employed. It must be borne in mind that in other factories the
“hands” were numbered, and, as was the case at Derby, were required to
attach each one his number below the general mark of the establishment.
At Worcester I am not aware that such a regulation existed; and thus,
probably, each artist had his “mark” instead. A few examples of these I
here give:—</p>

<p>After a time the Dresden and Sèvres productions were studied and
successfully followed at Worcester, the salmon-coloured ground and
<i>bleu de roi</i> being excellently managed. Tea and dessert services,
vases, &amp;c., were produced in these styles, some of which are remarkable
for the elegance of their painting and ornamentation. On many examples
of this period the Dresden mark was used, as shown in the accompanying
woodcut.</p>

<p>In March, 1756, “The proprietors of the Worcester China Manufacture,
for the better accommodation of merchants and traders, have opened a
warehouse at London House, Aldersgate Street, London, where they may be
supplied every day, between the hours of nine in the morning and three
in the afternoon, with a sortment of goods, wholesale, on the most
reasonable terms. Orders are likewise taken and executed with dispatch
for home and foreign trade.”</p>

<p>A remarkable bowl, apparently from a mould cast from a silver original,
is of the date of the commencement of these works. It is in possession
of Mrs. Barr, and bears beneath it the date
<img src="images/image229c.jpg" alt=""

Mr. Binns also
possesses specimens which may be attributed to about the same period.</p>

<p>In 1756, the truly important invention of printing on china,
<i>i.e.</i> transferring printed impressions from engraved
copper-plates on to the china body, is said to have been made in
Worcester. At all events, it is an undoubted fact that, in 1757, the
art in Worcester had arrived at a wondrous state of perfection; and it
is but fair, therefore, to say that the belief in its being practised
in the previous year is well founded. To have arrived at the state of
perfection which is exhibited in the example to which I am alluding (a
mug bearing the head of the King of Prussia, and dated 1757), must at
least have been the work of months, if not of years. The invention of
transfer printing is claimed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span> and very plausibly, for Liverpool, and
is said to have been made by Mr. John Sadler, who drew up papers, and
procured affidavits, for obtaining a patent, in August, 1756; on the
27th of July in that year he and his partner, Guy Green, were sworn to
have printed more than twelve hundred earthenware tiles in six hours.
Whether the Worcester idea was taken from Liverpool, or whether both
were taken from Battersea, or whether, as is not unfrequently the case,
the invention originated in two minds about the same time, without
one being at all connected with the other, it is not for me now to
determine. It is enough for my present purpose to say that <i>highly
finished</i> printed goods were made at Worcester in 1757, and the
dated example now in existence clearly establishes the fact that it was
a work of some forethought and care. On this mug the following poem
appeared in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for December, 1757:—</p>

<p class="left1 p-min"><i>Worcester, 20th Dec., 1757.</i></p>

<p>A different version of this poem was reprinted in the <i>Worcester
Journal</i> of January, 1758, with the addition of a couple of lines.
It is there headed:—“On seeing an armed bust of the King of Prussia
curiously imprinted on a Porcelain Cup of the Worcester Manufacture,
with Fame resounding her Trump and an emblematical representation
of his victories: Addressed to Mr. Josiah Holdship;” and an
“<i>extempore</i> on the compliment of imprinting the King of Prussia’s
Bust being ascribed to Mr. Josiah Holdship.” The <i>extempore</i> being
the following important lines:—</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
   <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft hangingindent">“Handcock, my friend, don’t <i>grieve</i>, tho’ Holdship has the praise,</div>
        <div>’Tis yours to execute—’tis his to wear the bays.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>From this it would seem that the credit of the invention (for more
information see the chapters on the Liverpool potteries and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span> the
Coalport china works) was even then a vexed question in Worcester;
some ascribing it to Holdship, and others to Hancock; and, no doubt,
each of those individuals claiming it for himself. Robert Hancock was
an engraver of some eminence in Worcester, and “was chief engraver<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
to the Worcester Porcelain Company on its first establishment;” and
it is also said he was in partnership with Dr. Wall. He died in 1817,
aged eighty-seven. Valentine Green, the historian of Worcester, and a
famous mezzo-tint engraver, was a pupil of Robert Hancock’s (by whom
many of the plates in his “History of Worcester” are engraved), as was
also James Ross, the line engraver. Valentine Green died in London in
1813, and was buried in the churchyard of St. Mary’s, Paddington, where
his gravestone now stands. Hancock, it is believed, had, previously
to printing on porcelain at Worcester, produced some printed plaques
at Battersea, specimens of which, with his name attached, are in
existence.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Richard Holdship, it will have been seen, was one of the original
proprietors of the Worcester works, and became, in 1751, the lessee of
the premises (Warmstry House) in which the manufacturing operations
were commenced. In 1759 he, conjointly with his brother Josiah
Holdship, purchased the property for £600, having previously purchased
some houses to the south of the works, on whose site he erected a large
and commodious mansion. He, however, became bankrupt in 1761, having
sold his shares in the porcelain works to Mr. David Henry, of London,
for the immense sum of five shillings.</p>

<p>Shortly after that, Holdship appears to have left Worcester, and, as
evidenced by the original deed in my own possession, in 1764 bound
himself by bond and various articles of agreement, to Messrs. Duesbury
and Heath, of Derby, for the making and printing china or porcelain
ware. In these “articles of agreement” he is described as “Richard
Holdship, of the city of Worcester, china maker,” and in it he agrees
for “the sum of one hundred pounds of lawful British money,” to be
paid down, and for an annuity of thirty pounds a year, to be paid
to him during life, to deliver to Messrs. Duesbury and Heath, “in
writing under his hand, the process now pursued by him the said Richard
Holdship, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span> making of china or porcelain ware, agreeable to the
proofs already made (by him) at the china manufactory of the said John
Heath and William Duesbury, in Derby;” also, “during his life to supply
and furnish” them “with a sufficient quantity of soapy rock used in
the making of china or porcelain ware, at such a price as any other
china manufacturers do, shall, or may at any time hereafter give for
that commodity;” and “also that he, the said Richard Holdship, shall
and will during his life print, or cause to be printed, all the china
or porcelain ware which the said John Heath and William Duesbury,
their heirs, &amp;c., shall from time to time have occasion to be printed,
of equal skill and workmanship, and upon as reasonable terms as the
said (Heath and Duesbury) can have the same done for by any other
person or persons whomsoever, or agreeable to the prices now given
in.” He also binds himself not to disclose or make known his process
to any other persons during the continuance of these articles, nor
to bequeath, sell, or communicate them to any persons, so as to take
place after his death, unless the articles are cancelled during his
lifetime. The agreement was to continue in force so long as Duesbury
and Heath determined to carry on the business according to his process;
and whenever they should decline doing so, then Holdship was to be at
liberty to sell or communicate his process to any one else. At Derby,
Holdship also printed stoneware. As I have stated in my account of
the Derby china works, the printed ware did not appear to meet Mr.
Duesbury’s views, or to be so advantageous as the higher class of
goods painted by hand, for which he was famed, and thus there were
constant complaints and recriminations passing between Holdship and
his employers. From some of the documents I glean that his process was
“for printing enamell and blew;” that he had an assistant named William
Underwood; that he valued his press at £10 10<i>s.</i>; offered his
“utensils and copper engraved plates at half prime cost;” that his
“enamell collours, weight 151 lbs.,” he valued at £35, including his
process for making the same; and that he proposes to “yield his process
for printing enamell and blew, for which he hath been offered several
hundred pounds.” How long the agreement continued I cannot say, but at
all events, Holdship was still employed at Derby at the end of 1769.</p>

<p>Of much of the work of Robert Hancock, fortunately, there can be no
possible doubt, for his name appears in full on some examples,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span> and his
initials—at least, initials believed to be his—on others. These will
be seen in the accompanying engraving:—</p>

  </div>

<p class="p-left">Two of these, it will be seen, are somewhat curious,
having the Chelsea anchor attached to the name of Worcester. It is a
problem worth solving whether this monogram of RH conjoined was that of
Robert Hancock, and, if so, whether he had previously been connected
with the Chelsea works; or whether the anchor was adopted as a mark
by Richard Holdship in allusion to his name, <i>hold ship</i>, which,
it must be admitted, would be a clever and very appropriate colophon.
The engraving, looked at as engraving alone, upon some of the pieces
of this period, is truly beautiful and sharp; but when considered as
<i>transfer</i> on to china paste, is very wonderful.</p>

<p>In Mr. Binns’s possession is a watch-back of Battersea enamel, transfer
printed, bearing the initials “R. H. f.” The subject was a popular one
for china and enamels, and was frequently reproduced.</p>

  </div>

<p>Richard Hancock, it is supposed, was employed at Battersea before
coming to Worcester, where he must have been settled before the date
(1757) of the poem just quoted. He was an excellent engraver, as
the watch-back (Fig. <a href="#image234b">518</a>) will testify. Examples of his engravings,
transferred on to <i>Chinese</i> porcelain, are also preserved, and are
considered to be his trial pieces from transferring on to this material.</p>

<p>The copper plate itself from which these foreign china specimens as
well as many of the choicest known examples of Worcester china have
been printed, I had myself the good fortune to discover a few years ago
at Coalport. It bears the engraver’s name—<i>R. Hancock fecit</i>.</p>

<p>I know, for the first time such a thing has been done, give as an
illustration (on Plate II.) impressions actually printed from this very
plate engraved by Hancock a century ago.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> On the same <span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>plate,
it will be noticed, is another engraving by Hancock, of a group of
children playing at “Blind Man’s Buff,” which collectors will recognise
as occasionally occurring on rare examples. On Plates III. and IV. I
also give, for the first time, impressions from other copper plates,
to which I shall make allusion later on. Among Hancock’s pupils were
Valentine Green, the historian of Worcester; James Ross, who earned
a considerable local reputation; and, it is believed, Thomas Turner,
afterwards of the Caughley china works. In 1769 Hancock purchased
from the mortgagees of Richard Holdship the buildings he had erected,
and became a partner in the china works; in which he held a sixth
share. The partnership, however, did not last long, and in 1774 he
was “paid out,” as appears by the following entry:—“Whereas certain
controversies, differences, and disputes had arisen between the parties
touching the said Robert Hancock’s share of the said stock, it was
agreed by indenture, dated October 31, 1774, in order to prevent all
such disputes, to purchase from him his share in said stock for the sum
of £900, being exactly one-sixth.” Hancock, it is said, left the works
in the same year, 1774. The group (Fig. <a href="#image234a">517</a>) exhibits a selection of
the early transfer-printing examples of Hancock’s work and that of his
clever contemporaries.</p>

<p>A few years before the Chelsea works passed into the hands of Duesbury
of Derby, it appears that some of the workmen migrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span> to Worcester,
and this circumstance gave a fresh impetus to the manufacture of
porcelain in that city, and enabled the proprietors of the works to
produce many exquisite articles after the Dresden and Sèvres schools of
art. Some examples of this Chelsea style are shown grouped on Fig. <a href="#image236">520</a>.
In 1776 Dr. Wall died, and was buried at the Abbey Church, Bath, in
which city he had resided for some time for the benefit of his impaired
and declining health. Soon after this time the works began to decline;
the goods produced were far inferior to those made in former years,
and their whole style, body, and finish showed an evident falling off
in the management of the works. It is surely not too much to attribute
this decadence in a great degree to the loss of the master mind of Dr.
Wall.</p>

<p>After many changes in proprietorship,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> the Worcester works, in 1783,
were purchased by Mr. T. Flight, a merchant of Bread Street, London,
and of Hackney (who was agent to the Worcester Porcelain Company), for
his sons, Joseph and John, for the sum of £3,000, including premises,
models, plant, and stock, and here he established them. These two
brothers were jewellers, and carried on both concerns at the same
time. Under their management the works rapidly more than regained
their former eminence, and became very successful.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span> The mark used by
Messrs. Flight was as follows— <img src="images/image237a.jpg" alt=""
style="height:3em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">
simply the name in writing letters.
Another mark of this period was the name, in italic
capitals, impressed on the ware, sometimes with the crescent painted in
blue. In 1786 Joseph Flight, one of the partners, “jeweller and china
manufacturer,” advertised that he had taken Mr. Bradley’s shop, 33,
High Street. Shortly afterwards he removed to larger premises, No. 45,
where he received the king and queen.</p>

<p>In 1788 an event of great importance to the works occurred. In that
year the king, George III., with Queen Charlotte and the princesses,
visited Worcester, and having gone through the porcelain works, and
been much pleased with the beauty of the articles manufactured, his
majesty desired that the word “royal” might be prefixed to the name,
and recommended the proprietors to open a show-room in London. This
suggestion was at once acted upon, and a warehouse opened in Coventry
Street, which secured a large and very fashionable patronage for the
ware. After the king’s visit the distinctive mark of a crown was added
to the marks, which at this time were the following. The subsequent
changes in the proprietorship, consequent on deaths, were “Messrs.
Flight and Barr”—Mr. Martin Barr having joined the concern in
1793—“Barr, Flight, and Barr,” and “Flight, Barr, and Barr” (Joseph
Flight, Martin Barr, and Martin Barr, jun., and afterwards George
Barr in place of the elder Martin). From 1829 till 1840 the firm was
simply “Barr and Barr,” the parties being Martin and George Barr. Some
of the marks I here give. Others, which were <i>printed</i> marks, it
is scarcely worth while to engrave; they are as follows:—“<i>Flight,
Barr, and Barr</i>”—B, the initial of Barr, scratched in the ware;
“Barr,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span> Flight, and Barr, Royal Porcelain Works, Worcester; London
House, No. 1, Coventry Street,” in five lines, and surmounted by two
crowns; “B.F.B.,” imprint on the ware: “Barr, Flight, and Barr, Royal
Porcelain Works, Worcester; London House, Flight and Barr, Coventry
Street” (within an oval), “Manufacturers to their Majesties, Prince
of Wales, and Royal Family; established 1751” (surrounding the oval);
the whole surmounted by a crown and the Prince of Wales’s feathers:
“Flight, Barr, and Barr, Proprietors of the Royal Porcelain Works,
Worcester, established 1761,” in five lines; above are the royal arms,
and beneath are the Prince of Wales’s feathers, the whole within a
circle; surrounding the circle is, “Manufacturers to their Majesties
and the Prince Regent; London Warehouse, No. 1, Coventry Street.”</p>

<p>In 1786, Robert Chamberlain, who was the first apprentice to the old
Worcester Porcelain Company, and who had continued with the different
proprietors up to that period, commenced business for himself in
premises at Diglis—the same which are now carried on by the Royal
Worcester Porcelain Company. Chamberlain was a painter, and on the
first establishment of his business bought his porcelain from the
Caughley works (Coalbrookdale) and painted it at Worcester. In a
very short time, however, he made his own, and his works soon grew
into public favour and eminence. His son was an excellent artist,
and a portrait of the Princess Charlotte, which he painted, is said
to have given the highest satisfaction to Prince Leopold and others.
The mark adopted by Chamberlain was simply his name in writing, thus,
“<i>Chamberlain’s</i>,” or <img src="images/image238a.jpg" alt=""
style="height:2.5em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">
completes the sentence.] Afterwards the following marks were used:—</p>

<p>As a companion picture to the fac-simile of Dr. Wall’s works I give
views of those of Chamberlain’s (Fig. <a href="#image239">537</a>), and, later, of Flight and
Barr’s, the latter copied from an engraving transferred to porcelain.
From these the extensive character of the place will be seen. It
has, however, been much increased since the amalgamation of the two
establishments, and within the last few years has been almost entirely
rebuilt by the present proprietors.</p>

<p>The business was afterwards carried on successively by “Chamberlain and
Sons” and “Chamberlain and Co.” During the continuance of the two works
it is believed that by far the greater part of the entire production of
porcelain in the kingdom was made at Worcester; and certainly the books
and the samples of various sets still remaining in the show-rooms bear
evidence both of the high patronage and the extent of orders received,
and of the beauty of workmanship which the proprietary had attained
in their ware. The successive changes in the proprietary were as
follows:—1786–1798, Robert Chamberlain, senior, Humphrey Chamberlain,
and Richard Nash (sleeping partner); 1798–1804, Humphrey Chamberlain
and Robert Chamberlain, junior; 1804–1811, the same, with G. E. Boulton
as sleeping partner; 1811–1827, the same, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span> Boulton; 1828–1840,
Walter Chamberlain and John Lilly. The marks then used, from 1840 to
1850, being <i>Chamberlain &amp; Co., Worcester</i>, in writing italics,
and CHAMBERLAIN’S in capital letters.</p>

<p>In 1800, a third china manufactory was established in Worcester by
Mr. Thomas Grainger, nephew of Humphrey Chamberlain, who had for many
years taken an active and principal part in Chamberlain’s works. This
establishment, of which a few words anon, is still continued by the son
of its founder and partners under the firm of “G. Grainger and Co.”</p>

<p>The two principal manufactories, those of “Flight, Barr, and Barr,” and
“Chamberlain and Co.,” continued until 1840, when they amalgamated, and
the two firms formed one joint-stock company. The plant and stock were
removed from Warmstry House to Messrs. Chamberlain’s premises, and the
works were there carried on under the style of “Chamberlain and Co.”
The mark used by Chamberlain and Co. was as follows:—</p>

<p>From 1840 to 1847 the managing directors were Walter Chamberlain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
John Lilly, and Martin and George Barr, and Fleming St. John; from
1848 to 1850 the proprietors were Walter Chamberlain and John Lilly;
in 1850, Walter Chamberlain and Edward Lilly. In 1850 Mr. W. H. Kerr
joined the concern, which was for a short time carried on under the
style of “Chamberlain, Lilly, and Kerr;” but on the 1st of January,
1852, another change took place in the proprietary. On this occasion
Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Lilly retired, and Mr. R. W. Binns entered into
partnership with Mr. Kerr, and the firm was carried on under the style
of “Kerr and Binns,” and “W. H. Kerr and Co.” In 1852 the works were
considerably increased, in fact they may almost be said to have been
then rebuilt, by Mr. Kerr, whose great desire was to make them the best
constructed, and most roomy and convenient, of any porcelain works in
the kingdom. In 1862 Mr. Kerr retired from the concern, and it is now
carried on by a company of shareholders, Mr. R. W. Binns, F.S.A., who
is one of them, holding the proud position of “Art Director,” a post
for which no man is better qualified than he is. The total number of
hands employed at the present time is between five and six hundred.</p>

<p>The productions of the Worcester works have been brought to a wondrous
state of perfection, both as to body, glaze, form, and decoration.
Certainly neither in ancient nor in modern specimens of ceramic
art have such exquisitely beautiful works been produced as some of
the enamels which, under the fostering hand of Mr. Binns, have of
late years been made here. The body, unlike the works of Limoges or
the Sèvres imitations, is <i>pure porcelain</i>, not a coating of
porcelain over sheets of metal; and the effect is produced by the
partial transparency of the white laid on the blue ground, instead
of by heightening. The tone produced in these enamels is peculiarly
soft and delicate, and the colours are pure and intense; they will
bear—and bear well—a close and critical comparison with those of
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Examples consisting of an
ewer and stand, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span> vase, a pastile-burner, a plate, a tazza, and other
articles, are given on Figs. <a href="#image243">547 to 553</a>. The late Mr. Bott, an artist
of the very highest eminence, was brought up by Mr. Binns specially
for the production of these enamels, and his early death has been a
great loss to Art. Through his death examples have become very scarce,
and realise high prices. At the present time a pair of vases—still
in the hands of the Worcester Company—are valued at 1,500 guineas,
and an ewer and basin at 350 guineas, and the probability is that they
will still increase rapidly in value. To Mr. Binns is entirely due the
introduction and carrying out of the Worcester enamels in the style of
Limoges; the ivory porcelain, a soft-glaze body of an ivory tint; the
Raphaelesque porcelain; jewelled porcelain, of a totally different and
far higher character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span> than that of Sèvres; and Japanese decoration on
porcelain and pottery. Besides these, to his taste, skill, and judgment
are due the great varieties of styles and improvements in form and
decoration which now characterize these works.</p>

<p>In parian, the Worcester works produce a large variety of figures,
busts, groups, and ornamental articles of every kind, and of a
remarkably clean and pure body.</p>

<p>The ivory porcelain—an improvement upon parian, and capable of greater
development—is one of the specialities of these works. Besides being
used for busts, figures, and ornamental pieces, in its simple state,
when it has all the softness, beauty, and natural tint of ivory
itself, it forms the basis of many of the ornamental decorations,
especially the Raphaelesque ware, which is the colouring of the surface
in relief in the style of the old Capo di Monte ware and the Buen
Retiro porcelain. This style was first introduced by Mr. Binns for the
Exhibition of 1862, and has retained its popularity to the present hour.</p>

<p>The jewelled porcelain, for which Worcester now is famous, is totally
different from that made at Sèvres or Tournay, whether ancient or
modern. The French jewels are all made by enamellers, and each colour
is fused on a small plate of metal which forms the setting, and may be
stuck on the vase or plate with gum if it is not required to pass it
through the fire. These jewels may be bought by the dozen or hundred in
any variety: but the work decorated with them is essentially French,
and tinselly. The English jewelling, though perhaps not so brilliant,
is of far higher and purer character, and is far more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span> legitimate
as a decoration for pottery. Each of these jewels is formed of colour
melted on to the china, and occasionally raised higher and higher by
repeated firings, and thus it becomes, and is, a part of the material
itself. The most elaborate piece of work produced at Worcester in
this style is a déjeûner set made for presentation to the Countess of
Dudley on her marriage, from the city of Worcester. It is powdered
all over with turquoise, but so arranged in geometric lines that only
the different sizes of the jewels are noticed. In Japanese porcelain
the Worcester works produce a vast variety of articles; amongst these
are vases, spill-cases, jardinières, toilet ornaments, trays, and
an infinite number of other elegancies. These Japanese productions
are not servile imitations of native art; they are Japanese art and
art-characteristics adapted and rendered subservient to the highest
aims of pure design of our own country. Mr. Binns, to whom this
introduction is owing, has caught the very spirit of Japanese art,
and, with the happy facility he possesses of turning everything to
good account, has so grafted it upon English productions that the
one becomes an essential and component part of the other. Among the
more pleasing and characteristic of the vases are a set on which the
designs, in relief (admirably modelled by Mr. Hadley) upon tablets,
represent the various processes of the potter’s art as followed in the
East; and these pictures—for true pictures they are—are so minutely
and exquisitely painted and gilded (by Callowhill), that it requires
a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span> lens to bring out their many and very minute beauties. Of
these I give some engravings. This introduction, which now forms a
distinctive feature of the Worcester works, is a marked and decided
advance in ceramic art; the effect of bronze and other metals being
quite an achievement.</p>

<p>In majolica the Worcester works produce many splendid varieties of
articles, and many spirited and beautiful designs. Dessert services,
floral table decorations, shell-pieces, spill-cases, and vases are
among the articles produced. The body is finer and more compact than
that frequently used by manufacturers, and the colouring is faultless
and in the purest taste. It was a wise thought to graft this branch of
ceramic art on to that of the finest porcelain at Worcester, and its
rapid development shows how thoroughly it has been appreciated.</p>

<p>But it is not in ornamental goods only that these works take high rank.
They produce every possible variety, from the simple gold and white
to the most highly decorated tea, coffee, déjeûner, dinner, toilet,
and other services. These are produced in very large quantities, and
form a staple and constantly increasing branch of the manufacture; and
in all these, however simple, the same purity of taste in patterns is
displayed as in the rarer and more costly gems of art.</p>

<p>It is a common belief that high art and commercial success cannot
go hand in hand,—that to make things <i>sell</i> you must sink
<i>art</i>—or that, if you produce high art examples, you must give up
all expectations of a remunerative trade. This theory I do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span> believe
in. I hold it to be the mission of the manufacturer, in whatever branch
he may be engaged, to produce such goods as shall tend to educate the
public taste, and to lead it gradually upwards to a full appreciation
of the beautiful. The manufacturer is quite as much a <i>teacher</i> as
the writer or the artist, and he is frequently a much more effectual
one. In pottery especially, where the wares of one kind or other are
hourly in the hands of every person in the kingdom, it behoves the
manufacturers to produce such perfect forms, and to introduce such
ornamentation, even in the commonest and coarsest ware, as shall teach
the eye, and induce a taste for whatever is beautiful and perfect and
lovely in art. The mission of the manufacturer is to <i>create</i> a
pure taste, not to perpetuate and pander to a vicious and barbarous
one; and I believe, in the end, that those who do their best to elevate
the minds of the people by this means will find that, commercially,
their endeavours will be most satisfactory—assuredly they will be
the most pleasant to their own minds. The Worcester people seem to
understand this thoroughly, and to have wisely determined that nothing,
even of the most simple design or common use, which is not pure in
taste and elegant in form shall be issued from their works.</p>

<p>The Worcester works have, at one time or other, been favoured more than
most English establishments with orders from royalty. Of these I give
five examples of plates, to show the beauty and intricacy of their
designs. Fig. <a href="#image251b">569</a> is a part of a service made for the Queen; Fig. <a href="#image253b">573</a>,
from the service made for Prince William Henry, Duke of Clarence, in
1789; 572, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span> Princess Charlotte on her marriage; 571 for his
Majesty King William IV.; and 570, for the Duke of Cumberland in 1806.</p>

<p>A curious feature in connection with these works, and one which I am
only aware has been followed by one other English china manufactory
(that of Pinxton), was the issuing of porcelain tokens—that is, china
money—for the convenience of the masters and workmen at the factory.
They are, it will be seen, in the form of a promissory note. They bear
the “promise” on the obverse, and on the reverse the letters W P C
(Worcester Porcelain Company), and were issued for various amounts.</p>

<p><i>Royal China Works.</i>—The porcelain works of Messrs. Grainger
and Co. are situated in St. Martin’s Street, with show-rooms in the
Foregate. They were established in 1800, as I have before stated, by
Mr. Thomas Grainger, nephew to Mr. Chamberlain, to whom he served an
apprenticeship as a painter; the latter part of his apprenticeship
being devoted to taking a share in the general management of the
works. When out of his time, Mr. Grainger started a manufactory on
his own account, and took into partnership a Mr. Wood, a painter
of considerable skill and eminence, whose productions on the early
porcelain made by them are characterized by a peculiar mellowness
of shade, and who excelled in “mezzo-tint drawing;” and the works
were carried on for some time under the firm of “Grainger and Wood.”
<img src="images/image254c.jpg" alt=""
style="height:3.5em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">
Afterwards, Mr. Grainger took into partnership his brother-in-law, Mr.
Lee, and the style of the firm was then changed to that of “Grainger
and Lee.” The mark was as appended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span></p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image255">

    src="images/image255.jpg"
     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center sm">Fig. 577.</p>
  </div>

<p>In 1810, about two years before Mr. Lee became a partner, the works
were destroyed by fire. The manufactory was shortly rebuilt on a new
site, on the opposite side of the street, and has been considerably
enlarged. Mr. Lee having retired from the concern, the business was
then carried on by Mr. Grainger until his decease in 1839, when his
son, Mr. George Grainger, one of the present proprietors, succeeded
him, and has carried on the works, under the style of “G. Grainger and
Co.,” to the present day. Up to the year 1850, porcelain alone was made
at this establishment, and its quality was remarkably good, both in
body and in ornamentation. In that year, however, Mr. George Grainger
invented a new body, which he named “<i>semi-porcelain</i>.” This new
ware was first made public at the Great International Exhibition of
1851, and from its peculiar qualities of durability, hardness, and
freedom from cracking with heat, attracted considerable attention. The
surface of the semi-porcelain bears every characteristic of the finest
china, and, of course, in colour, in painting, and in gilding can be
made quite equal to it; but it has the additional advantage of being
so completely vitrified that the inside, in case of being chipped or
broken, remains of its original whiteness. It is peculiarly adapted for
dinner-services through not flying or cracking with heat so readily as
the ordinary china does, and because of its power of retaining heat
for a much longer time. It is somewhat extensively exported both to
France and to India. Mr. Grainger manufactures very largely of this
material chemical vessels, batteries, insulators for telegraph wires,
&amp;c., and for these purposes its superiority is admitted by the highest
scientific authorities. These insulators (in an unglazed state) after
being soaked for many hours in acid, stood the test of a battery of
two hundred Daniel’s cells—a very severe test—showing thus great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
strength and resisting power—a strength which would be much increased
when glazed.</p>

<p>The mark of the present firm is as follows:—
<img src="images/image256a.jpg" alt=""
style="height:6em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">
Another has simply the words “Chemical Porcelain, Grainger and Co., Manufactory,
Worcester.” Messrs. Grainger and Co. also produce some admirable vases,
excellent parian figures and ornaments. Another variety of goods is
the perforated parian ware, in which is made vases, &amp;c., of remarkably
pure design and careful execution. Some of the best specimens of lace
drapery have been produced by this firm. At the Exhibition of 1862, the
last at which the firm exhibited, a medal was awarded them for this
“semi-” or “chemical porcelain,” which, undeniably, well deserved such
a distinction.</p>

<p>A new invention of Messrs. Grainger is their “Opalite,” a highly
vitrified and very fine body, in which they have produced, with
remarkably good effect, embossed tiles for external decorations in
shop fronts, &amp;c. A design of a celadon ground with the blackberry,
conventionally treated, in relief, in white, with the stems relieved
with burnished gold, burned into the body, is remarkably beautiful and
effective.</p>

<p><i>Mr. St. John’s Encaustic Tile Works.</i>—After the removal of
Messrs. Flight and Barr’s works to the present site of the Royal
porcelain manufactory, on the amalgamation spoken of on a preceding
page, Mr. Barr for a time continued making encaustic paving tiles
on the old premises. In this he was joined by Mr. Fleming St. John,
who was one of the managing directors of the Royal porcelain works,
and some excellent patterns, and of good colour and material, were
produced. The tile works were, however, in 1860, sold to Messrs. Maw,
who continued to carry on the manufacture until 1852, when they removed
to Broseley, where the manufacture is still continued (see “Broseley”).
In 1853 the premises were purchased from Mr. Fleming St. John by Mr.
Allcroft, one of the partners in the firm of Dent, Allcroft, and Co.,
and their business of glove-making was removed within the same year.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>“Worcester Tileries,” Rainbow Hill.</i>—These works were
established in 1870 by Mr. H. C. Webb, their present proprietor. The
tiles produced are in three series—1st, geometrical tiles in five
colours, viz. black, red, buff, grey, and chocolate; 2nd, geometrical
tiles in these colours with the addition of cream, fawn, blue, white,
and green; 3rd, the whole of these, with encaustic or inlaid tiles
added. The geometrical tiles are made of various sizes and of every
necessary shape, and thus pavements of admirable and effective design
and of endless variety are produced, which are equally suitable for
small villas, cottages, schools, &amp;c. The colours are clear and good,
and the quality hard and durable. The mark used by Mr. Webb is the
name HENRY C. WEBB, WORCESTER, in raised letters, in a small circle
impressed in the clay.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>St. George’s Pottery Works.</i>—These works were established
by their present proprietor, Mr. D. W. Barker, formerly of Frome
in Somersetshire, in 1869, for the manufacture of rustic ware,
terra-cotta,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span> and patent bricks—the latter being the main production
of the establishment. The works are situated on Gregory’s Bank, close
to the canal, on the north side of Worcester, where they occupy a
large area of ground. The kilns were erected from the designs of the
patentees, Hoffman and Licht, of Berlin and Dantzic, and the machinery
by the patentees, Bradley and Craven, of Wakefield. As these are said
to be among the best constructed of modern brick and terra-cotta works,
I quote the following particulars:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The kiln consists of a long railway-tunnel-shaped passage,
forming a long annular channel or ring. This ring is divided
into twelve compartments, which may be made to communicate or
to be separated from each other by the raising or lowering
of a partition or damper. To each compartment there is an
entrance-doorway, which can be closed with temporary brickwork.
Flues lead from the bed of each compartment to the central
smoke-chamber, which communicates by a main flue with the
chimney. The state and progress of the fire can be at any time
easily seen through the apertures on the top, down which the
fuel is passed; and as the draught is under perfect control,
the heat can be at once raised or lowered as may be required.
The low temperature at which the gases leave the kiln is
indicated by the fact that a high chimney for getting up the
draught is required. There is thus a perpetual current, so to
say, of bricks, which is brought slowly to revolve against, and
in the contrary direction to, a perpetually revolving draught.
In the green stage of the bricks they thus come in contact with
air at a comparatively low temperature, and then gradually
advance towards higher temperatures until they are at last
burnt. Each stack of bricks to be burnt is, therefore, most
ingeniously made to combine successively—(1) the functions of
a grate with bars; (2) of a Leimen’s regenerator, for heating
the air to be burnt; (3) of a drying-room for themselves when
green; and (4) of a cooling-room for themselves when burnt.
It is impossible not to enjoy the examination of such an
exemplification of the dominion of mind over matter. Each day
one chamber is emptied of its burnt and cooled-down bricks,
and another chamber is filled with green goods. Any repairs
can also be at once done to any one of the chambers as it gets
emptied in its turn. In every process of treating clay or marl,
with a view to drying it in the open air or to burning it, it
is absolutely necessary to carry out these operations gradually
at the risk of cracking and splitting the goods. This kiln,
from its very gradual action and absence of sudden changes of
temperature, produces no “wasters” from these causes, and the
bricks can also be burnt in a much more moist state than in
ordinary kilns, as the heat is very gradually brought to bear
upon them. The extraordinary and widespread success of the
patent annular kilns, the beauty of the scientific principles
they so ingeniously embody, and the many fresh applications of
which they are capable, are well deserving a careful study. In
all there are not less than five hundred of these kilns at work
in different parts of the world—Europe, the United States,
India, and Australia. In England and her colonies alone there
are upwards of ninety in use, and the power of production,
within merely England and Ireland, can be reckoned at nearly
one million of bricks <i>daily</i>. Our Admiralty use five,
the Indian Government already six. In the Patent Kiln there is
an important source of saving in the fact that the moisture is
driven into the chimney, and is never carried over the fuel,
uselessly conveying away, as it would do, enormous amounts of
latent heat. The chimney, which rises from the centre of the
kiln, is of a circular form, about 160 feet in height, 21 feet
6 inches in diameter at the base, and 7 feet 6 inches at the
top.”</p>
</div>

<p>The analysis of the clay, as reported by Dr. Arthur E. Davis, is as
follows:—silica, 56·74; alumina, 31·66; oxide of iron, 6·96; lime,
3·43; magnesia, trace; alkaline salts, 0·53; loss in analysis, 0·68;
total, 100·00.</p>

<p>The rustic terra-cotta ware produced at these works is of a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
superior quality, and the designs are so true to nature as to be
faultless in every respect. In this ware garden-seats, flower-pots,
and flower-vases, mignonette and other boxes, spill-cases, and a
variety of other articles have been made, and all are equally good in
design. Among the rustic flower-pots and stands some are excellent
representations of the gnarled root of a tree; the small branches
of trees nailed to the sides of the vessel; and the bole of a tree
beautifully modelled, and apparently hollowed out to receive the plant.
In these cases the grain of the wood is well copied. Mr. Barker’s great
forte in these designs seems to have been the accurate and truthful
copying of nature in the barks and peculiarities of growth of various
trees.</p>

<p>Mr. Barker manufactures the ceramic part of Beckitt’s patent
photographic apparatus—an apparatus consisting of an earthenware
cylinder and a series of troughs of the same material, in which the
cylinder is made to revolve by means of a handle; the troughs being
intended for the hyposulphate bath, the gold solution, and wash,
respectively.</p>

<p>Ordinary flower-pots and other horticultural ware, of good quality and
excellent material, are extensively made, and form a staple branch of
the St. George’s trade.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Mr. George King Harrison, of the “Lye Works,”
Stourbridge, for the following interesting particulars respecting
Stourbridge clay. He says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The earliest account I have been able to obtain respecting
Stourbridge fire-clay shows that, in the year 1566, a lease
was granted for the purpose of getting and digging Glasshouse
pot-clay. It is probable at that time it had only recently been
discovered, and that its peculiar properties and purity, with
the well-known abundance of fuel in the neighbourhood, were the
causes of the establishment of the glass manufacture, which was
introduced by refugees from Lorraine about 1557. It is believed
that one of the first glasshouses was erected in a field (near
to Stourbridge Station), and which is known by the name of the
Glasshouse Field at the present time; an old plan shows the
position of the works, foundations of furnaces, and portion of
old furnace.”</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. Plot, in his “History of Staffordshire,” date about 1686, says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The most preferable clay of any is that of Amblecote, of a
dark blewish colour, whereof they make the best pots for the
glasshouses of any in England; nay, so very good is it for
this purpose that it is sold in the place for 7<i>d.</i> the
bushel, whereof Mr. Gray (an ancestor of the present Earl
of Stamford and Warrington) has 6<i>d.</i> and the workman
1<i>d.</i>, and so very necessary to be had that it is sent as
far as London, some time by waggon and some time on pack horses
to Bewdley, and so down the Severn to Bristol, and thence to
London.” “The goodness of which clay and cheapness of coal
hereabouts no doubt has drawn the glasshouses both for vessels
and broad glass into these parts, there being divers set up in
different forms here at Amblecote, Oldwynford, Hollowaysend,
and Coburnbrook.”</p>
</div>

<p>Stourbridge clay (<i>properly so called</i>) is found only in a
comparatively small district, say within a circle of not more than two
miles, taking the valley of the Stour at the Lye as the centre, and
at depths varying from three or four yards from the surface to one
hundred and eighty yards; its position in the strata is in all cases
below the thick coal, at distances varying from twelve to twenty-five
yards; and it is generally overlaid by a shaly, friable kind of coal,
called “batts,” from twelve to twenty-four inches thick. The thickness
of the seam varies very much, rarely exceeding thirty-six to forty-two
inches, and sometimes thinning down to five or six inches when close
to faults or small disturbances in the measures. The quality is very
variable, in some instances as hard as stone, having to be blasted
with powder, and in others soft and easily workable. There is a great
variation in its component parts, arising principally in the proportion
of silica; a clay containing only about fifty per cent. of silica being
very inferior, and contracting very much on exposure to intense heat.
In order to show this difference in a practical form I have had eight
clays from as many mines in the Stourbridge district, prepared under
precisely similar circumstances, subjected to the same heat, and all
burnt in the kiln at one time.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span> The result showing the great variation
and power of resisting heat, since, in the eight samples, hardly two
are of the same weight and size. The eight bricks all made in one mould.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img
    class="p1" 
    src="images/image262.jpg"
    alt="">
  </div>

<p>The usual treatment of clay for glass-house purposes is as follows.
After having been carefully selected, it is broken into small pieces
by women accustomed to its appearance, who throw on one side all
pieces of discoloured and irregular clay; it is finely ground by heavy
edge-runners, and mixed with a certain proportion of ground potsherds
(old broken burnt pots); the proportion of burnt clay varies according
to the purpose for which the clay is to be used; it is then mixed with
water, and tempered with the foot, and allowed to lie a considerable
time—which should not be less than six or seven weeks—when it should
acquire great tenacity before being made into pots.</p>

<p>These pots are built up by hand gradually, great care being taken that
the last layer of clay is not allowed to become hard or dry, or it will
not unite properly; neglect in this respect causing the pot to give way
in the furnace. The pots are dried very gradually, and are seldom fit
for use under six to eight months.</p>

<p>The clay, after the selection of the best pot-clay, is allowed to lie
in large heaps, subjected to the action of the atmosphere, and is then
used in the manufacture of gas-retorts, fire-bricks, &amp;c. The quantity
of bricks made annually in the Stourbridge district is about fifty
millions.</p>

<p>In the midst of one of the most historically interesting districts of
the kingdom—a district abounding in spots rendered famous in various
ages by the events which have occurred within its boundaries, and full
of associations as varied as they are interesting—within a few miles
of Boscobel, and Tong, and numberless other places possessing a sad
interest as connected with the wanderings and the painful vicissitudes
of King Charles II.,—within a short distance of those two glorious
monastic ruins, Buildwas Abbey and Wenlock Priory—not far from the
“English Nineveh,” Uriconium, and within easy distance of Shrewsbury
and Ludlow,—is a group of manufactories whose simple history is as
interesting as that of many of these places.</p>

<p>Broseley, whose pipe manufactories two hundred and fifty years ago
were as famed as they are now, and whose makers then got rid of
their goods without advertising the emphatic words, “When you ask
for a Broseley pipe, see that you get it!”—Jackfield, famed of old
for its earthenware, and where it is still to some little extent
made;—Caughley, formerly a successful rival of Worcester in the
excellence of its porcelains;—Coalport, a rival of all other works at
the present day;—Horsehay, with its discontinued pot works;—Benthall,
where “yellow ware” works are in constant operation, and where the
magnificent encaustic and enamelled tile and mosaic works of Messrs.
Maw are situated;—Ironbridge, with its famous one-arch bridge,
the first iron bridge erected in England, from which it takes its
name, spanning the Severn:—Madeley, with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span> extensive iron
furnaces;—Benthall Edge, with its limestone works;—Coalbrookdale,
whose iron works are known throughout the world, and where <i>terra
cotta</i> is manufactured,—and a score of other busy hives of
industry, are here gathered together, and demand careful attention. To
the history of some of these I therefore devote this chapter.</p>

<p>Like those of Worcester and Derby, the Salopian manufactory of
porcelain dates from the middle of last century; and, like them, has
continued from its first introduction to the present time without
interruption. Indeed, it may be said of the district that an almost—if
not an entirely—unbroken historical chain may be traced from the
Romano-British period down to the present day; for, as I have already
shown, the same beds of clay which, fifteen hundred years ago, produced
some of the fictile ware of the Roman occupiers of the soil, have been
worked in the intermediate ages, and still produce, more largely than
ever, articles of daily use for every class of the people of England.
The same beds which supplied the magnificent city of Uriconium with
jugs, mortaria, bowls, and colanders of white ware, still supply the
neighbourhood with innumerable articles of daily use.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Caughley.</h3>

<p>The Worcester porcelain works, as I have shown, were established in the
year 1751; and the commencement of those in Shropshire must have been,
if not coeval, at all events closely subsequent to that event. Indeed,
the two works may be almost said to have sprung into existence at the
same time. The site of the first Salopian china works was at Caughley,
about a mile from the present manufactory, and on the opposite or
south side of the river Severn. The works were situated on the hill
overlooking the valley of the Severn, as it flowed on to Bridgnorth,
and commanding a magnificent view of the surrounding country. On
this spot, it is said, a small pottery was begun by a Mr. Browne,
of Caughley Hall, and after his death managed by a gentleman named
Gallimore, who was a relative, to whom, in 1754, a lease of the place
was granted for the term of sixty-two years. This Mr. Gallimore does
not appear to have been long connected with the works; for the only
name, as proprietor, which I have at present been able to establish,
is that of Mr. Thomas Turner, who married Dorothy, daughter of Mr.
Gallimore and niece to Mr. Browne, and carried on the manufactory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Turner was the son of Dr. Richard Turner, of Magdalene
Hall, Oxford, rector of Cumberton, vicar of Elmly Castle and Norton,
all in Worcestershire, in 1754, and who was also chaplain to the
Countess of Wigtoun. This Dr. Turner, who took his degree at Magdalene
Hall, Oxford, was the author of several works on astronomy, gauging,
trigonometry, education, history, &amp;c., and, in 1765, was a “teacher of
geometry, astronomy, and philosophy” at Worcester. He died in 1791, and
was buried at Norton-juxta-Kempsey, near Worcester. Besides his son
Thomas, he had two other sons, Richard, LL.D., and Edward, the first
of whom also published some works on geography, &amp;c., and the latter
was a general in the army in India, where he died; and two daughters,
Elizabeth, married to Abraham Wyke, of Broseley, surgeon, and Sarah,
married to Dr. William Hancock Roberts, rector of Broadwas and minor
canon of Worcester Cathedral. Mr. Thomas Turner, by his first wife,
Dorothy Gallimore, who died in 1793, had issue two children who died
in infancy; and by his second wife, Mary, daughter of Thomas Milner,
of Dothill, and widow of Henry Alsop, had issue one son, George Thomas
Turner, of High Broughton, near Manchester, who died at Scarborough
March 17, 1869, without issue, and one daughter, Catherine Georgiana
Cecilia, who married John Jacob Smith, of St. James’s Priory,
Bridgnorth, for more than half a century town clerk of that borough,
by whom he had issue the present Hubert Smith, Esq., of St. Leonards,
Bridgnorth, the gifted author of “Tent Life with English Gipsies in
Norway,” who is the lineal and only representative of the main line of
the Turner family. Mr. Turner was born in 1749, and is said to have
been brought up as a silversmith at Worcester; but this is an error,
as, for the purpose of obtaining the freedom of the city, he was, as a
matter of legal form only, apprenticed to his father. It seems pretty
certain that he was, at an early period, connected with the Worcester
china works, and it is an established fact that he was an excellent
chemist, and had thoroughly studied the various processes relating to
porcelain manufacture. He was also a skilful draftsman and designer,
and occasionally engraved: he was also a clever musician. He became
a county magistrate for Shropshire, and was a freeman of the city of
Worcester and the boroughs of Wenlock and Bridgnorth. He was also
chairman of the Court of Equity for the three counties, which he had
been mainly instrumental in establishing. In 1772, he succeeded his
father-in-law, Mr. Gallimore, at the Caughley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span> works (Mr. Gallimore
having leased them from Mr. Browne in 1754), and carried them on until
1799, when he sold out all interest in the works and retired from
business. He died at his residence at Caughley in 1809, aged sixty, and
was buried in the family vault at Barrow, where, later, his daughter,
Mrs. Smith, was also buried. After his death the commissioners of
Oldbury Court presented his widow with a memorial silver cup of large
size, bearing on one side the arms of Turner, and on the other an
appropriate inscription. This is in possession of his representative,
Mr. Hubert Smith.</p>

<p>Mr. Turner had a partner named Shaw. They had a warehouse in London,
and, as was usual in those days with other works, had periodical sales
by auction of their goods. In my own possession is a bill of this firm,
dated January 24th, 1794, and headed “Salopian China Warehouse. Bought
of Turner and Shaw.” The lots in this bill were bought “at public
sale,” and consisted of “jugs,” “bakings,” “china dishes,” and other
“sundry pieces;” the lots were “put up at half price” at the sale.
In 1795, Mr. Turner’s manager at Caughley was one Thomas Blase; and
I have a letter of his, dated 20th February in that year, concerning
a painter, named Withers, at that time employed there, but who had
wrongfully left his employment at the Derby china works, where he was
“Mr. Deusbury’s articled servant.”</p>

<p>No doubt the incentive to the establishment of the Caughley works were
the experiments long carried on at Worcester by Dr. Wall, and the
knowledge that at this spot the two principal materials wanting in a
pottery of this kind could be had at a trifling cost. With abundance of
coal within twenty feet of the surface, with clunch of the best quality
for the making of seggars overlying the coal, and with the navigable
river at hand for bringing the materials and for carrying away the
finished goods, the inducements were strong for the fixing on this
spot the manufactory which was destined ultimately to grow into such
enviable importance. To Worcester, of course, coal and clunch and other
materials had to be conveyed at great cost; but here they were ready
to hand, and indeed were cropping out in every direction, inviting
to be used. In 1756 the works had attained a considerable degree of
excellence; and an example is in existence, bearing that date, which
gives most satisfactory evidence of the excellence of the body at that
time—a body, however, which speedily became greatly improved. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
early years of the Caughley manufactory, the ware was not many degrees
removed from earthenware; but it gradually assumed a finer and more
transparent character. Like the early Worcester examples, the patterns
were principally confined to blue flowers, &amp;c., on a white ground; and
in this style and colour the Caughley works excelled, in many respects,
their competitors. An excellent example of the body, as made in 1776,
is exhibited in a mug, bearing that date, now in the possession of a
family at Coalport. This interesting mug, here engraved, is white, with
blue and gold flowers, and bears the words “Francis Benbow, 1776,”
surmounted by an anchor; the Francis Benbow, for whom it was made,
being a barge-owner.</p>

<p>In 1772, as I have shown, Mr. Turner succeeded Mr. Gallimore in these
works, and set about enlarging them. In 1775 we read, “The porcelain
manufactory erected near Bridgnorth, in this county, is now quite
completed, and the proprietors have received and completed orders to
a very large amount. Lately we saw some of their productions, which
in colour and fineness are truly elegant and beautiful, and have
the bright and lively white of the so much extolled oriental.” In
1780 he visited France, for the purpose of “picking up knowledge” on
the porcelain manufactures of Paris and other places. He is said to
have been an excellent draughtsman, and this added to his chemical
knowledge—for he had a regular laboratory fitted up at the top of
his house—must have been a great advantage to him while in that
country of beautiful and chaste designs. On his return from France
he brought with him some skilled workmen, and at once entered with
increased spirit into the manufacture of porcelain in his own works
at Caughley. One of the men whom he had brought over appears to have
been a clever architect; and from his design a very tasty and elegant
château, which he called “Caughley Place,” and where he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span> resided, was
built for Mr. Turner, near the works. This building being of a novel
design in England—more especially in the sequestered neighbourhood
of Caughley—attracted much attention; and its peculiarities of
construction and arrangement are still often talked about by the old
inhabitants of the place. This house and Caughley Hall, after Mr.
Turner’s death, came into the hands of Lord Forester, and were pulled
down in 1820 or 1821; part of the materials being used for making
additions to the present works at Coalport. At the present time no
vestiges of the house or works remain at Caughley, with the exception
of traces of foundations, and here and there a spring flower or two
which still make their appearance where once the elegantly laid out
gardens existed.</p>

<p>In 1780 Mr. Turner introduced the making of the famous “Willow
Pattern”—the first made in England—at Caughley, and about the same
time the “Broseley Blue Dragon” pattern. The willow pattern is still
commonly known in the trade as “Broseley pattern.”</p>

<p>An excellent example of dated Caughley ware is the puzzle-jug in
the possession of Mr. Edmund Thursfield, here engraved. It is eight
inches in length, and is formed of the usual body of these works. It
is decorated with blue sprigs, and bears on its front the name, in an
oval border, of “John Geary Cleak of the old Church Brosley 1789.” On
the bottom is written in blue, “Mathew the v &amp; 16,” though one would
fail to see any allusion in the text here referred to either to the
vessel or to its purpose. In Mr. Smith’s possession is a fine Caughley
mug; white, with blue flowers of bold character: it bears the words,
“Wm. Haslewood, 1791,” and has the mark S on the bottom. This William
Haslewood was the representative of an old family of that name in this
neighbourhood, and his property passed to the Mr. J. J. Smith already
spoken of.</p>

<p>In 1788 Mr. Robert Chamberlain commenced his china works at Worcester,
and for some time bought his ware at Caughley, had it sent down by
barge to Worcester, and there painted and finished it. The same
thing was also done when Grainger’s works were first started at
Worcester. The number of hands employed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span> at Caughley must have been
somewhat large, as the premises were extensive, and the quantity of
goods required by Mr. Turner, for his own trade and for Worcester,
was considerable. In 1798 or 1799, in consequence of the increase of
the trade of Mr. Rose, who had been apprenticed to Mr. Turner, and
afterwards commenced on his own account, by which the Caughley business
was much injured, the works were disposed of to Mr. Rose and his
partner; Mr. Turner entirely retiring from the concern. The Caughley
works were then carried on by Messrs. Rose and Co., in conjunction
with their own. The coal at Caughley beginning to work out, and the
cost of carrying the unfinished ware from thence down the hill and
across the water to Coalport was so great,—the unfinished ware being
carried on women’s heads the whole distance,—that Mr. Rose determined
to remove the works to Coalport, which he did at different times,
gradually drafting off the workmen, until about 1814 or 1815, when
they were finally removed, the kilns and rooms taken down, and the
materials used for the enlargement of the works at Coalport. The last
of the buildings, with the house, were not, however, destroyed until
1821, when the materials were brought to Coalport to build the present
burnishing-shops and some workmen’s cottages.</p>

  </div>

<p>The works were built in form of a quadrangle, with an entrance gateway
surmounted by an inscribed stone. Of these historical works I am
enabled, through the courtesy of my friend Mr. Hubert Smith, to give
an engraving from an original drawing in his possession.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span> The entrance
building, it will be seen, was three stories in height, the remainder
two stories, and the kilns were of large size.</p>

<p>The marks used at Caughley and Coalport have been very few, but they
are very important, and require careful attention at the hands of the
collector. In my account of the Worcester works I have given several
varieties of the <i>crescent</i> as a mark of that establishment, and
have also stated that it was used at Caughley. I believe the first
mark used at Caughley to have been the crescent alone, and that it
was, as I have before stated, intended to have the signification of a
C for Caughley, and that its connection with the Worcester works may,
in a great measure, be traced to the fact of the goods on which it
appears being printed, not at that city, but at Caughley. I have seen
examples of this mark on undoubted Worcester body, and also on equally
undoubted Caughley make, bearing precisely the same printed patterns.
The following are some of the varieties of the crescent occurring on
Caughley specimens, and show pretty clearly its transition from a
common “half-moon” (I have often heard it called “half-moon china”) to
the finished and engraved C.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image270a">

     <p class="p0 center sm">Figs. 588 to 592.</p>
  </div>

<p>Another mark said to have been used at Caughley, but of which at
present I have met with no example, is the accompanying,
<img src="images/image270b.jpg" alt=""
style="height:3em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">
 which is very
similar to the mark ascribed to the Leeds manufactory.</p>

<p>Another distinctive mark of the Salopian works was the capital letter
S, of which the following are varieties:—</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image270c">
     <img
    class="p1"

     <p class="p0 center sm">Figs. 594 to 600.</p>
  </div>

<p>When the S was introduced it is difficult to say; but, at all events,
it appears on the dated example alluded to above in 1776, and it was
used at the same time as the C for a considerable period. On many of
the engraved plates still in existence, indeed, both the C and the S
occur, and this leads me to suspect that the one was used to mark the
goods sent to Caughley to be printed, and the other those made <span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>and
printed for their own market. I have seen precisely similar articles in
pattern, bearing each of these letters. Occasionally the S and crossed
daggers occur.</p>

occur side by side on the original copper-plate.)</p>
  </div>

<p>Another circumstance is also worthy of note. On two mugs printed
from the same engraved plate, which I have seen, the one bears the
S, and the other the accompanying curious mark (Fig. <a href="#image270c">598</a>), which is
evidently of the same character as the examples of assimilated Chinese
ones, which are occasionally ascribed to Worcester, but which are in
reality, I believe, those of Caughley. Of these I give the following as
examples; many of these are disguised figures.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image271a">

     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center sm">Figs. 601 to 606.</p>
  </div>

<p>Following the C and S, two <i>impressed</i> marks, bearing the word
“Salopian,” were used. These are as follows:—</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image271b">
     <img
    class="p1"   
    src="images/image271b.jpg"
     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center sm">Figs. 607 and 608.</p>
  </div>

<p>and it is worthy of remark that, on some examples of plates bearing
this impressed mark, the blue printed S also appears; as, on others,
does also the crescent. Others, probably merely workmen’s marks, are
<img src="images/image271c.jpg" alt=""
style="height:3em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;"></p>

<p>The subject of <i>printing</i> upon porcelain, to which I have already
alluded under “Worcester,” is one so intimately and intricately
connected with the Caughley and Coalport works, that it will be
necessary to consider the period of its introduction at some length. I
have already shown that transfer-printing was used as early as 1757 on
Worcester porcelain (p. 229, <i>ante</i>); and I have little doubt that
quite as early, if not a few years before that period, it was practised
at Caughley. Indeed, in the early years of the manufactory, the two
works, Caughley and Worcester, seem to have been closely connected,
and to have worked “in and in,” if I may be allowed the use of so
unscientific an expression, and I believe, with ample reason, that a
great proportion of the printed goods bearing the Worcester mark were
printed at Caughley. Indeed, it is known that the ware<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span> was sent up
from Worcester by barge to be printed at Caughley, and returned, when
finished, by the same mode of conveyance. I have closely examined the
style of engraving and the patterns of a large number of examples, and
I am clearly of opinion that they are the work of the same hands.</p>

<p>I do not, by this, claim for Caughley the honour of <i>inventing</i>
the art of transfer-printing on to porcelain; but I feel assured
that that art must have been there practised at quite as early a
period as the dated example of Worcester make; and I am led to this
belief partly from the fact that the Robert Hancock whose beautiful
productions I have before spoken of, and to whom the engraving of the
dated example is ascribed, also engraved for the Caughley works. And I
have an impression of a plate, of an identical pattern with the famous
tea group, which bears his monogram on the Worcester specimens, on
which his name, <i>R. Hancock fecit</i>, occurs in full at Caughley.
Collectors, therefore, in a case of this kind, must not be too hasty in
ascribing, from appearance <i>alone</i>, examples to either one or the
other make, but must be guided, in a great measure, by the <i>body</i>
on which the engraving occurs.</p>

<p>It cannot be wondered that an art, then such an important secret,
should have been followed at Caughley,—a place so perfectly retired
from the world, situated in the midst of woods and wilds, almost
unapproachable to strangers, and with every facility for keeping the
workmen away from all chance of imparting the secret to others,—in
place of in Worcester, where secrecy would be almost impossible, and
where the information would ooze out from the workmen, at the ale-house
or elsewhere, and be greedily caught up by those interested in the
process. At Caughley every possible precaution seems to have been taken
to secure secrecy; and the workmen—the engravers and printers—were
locked up and kept apart from every one else. Who the engravers were
I cannot satisfactorily say. It is, however, certain, that Hancock
engraved for the works; and it is said that Holdship, of whom I have
before spoken, was also employed. Among the other engravers was a man
named Dyas, who was apprenticed as an engraver at Caughley about the
year 1768, and who continued at the works until his death, at the ripe
age of eighty-two. It is also worthy of note that Mr. Minton, the
father of Mr. Herbert Minton, was in his early days employed as an
engraver at these works. It is not too much to say, that the style of
engraving adopted at so early a period was remarkably good, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>of
really high character. Indeed, some specimens which I have seen of the
plates used at Caughley are far superior to most of the productions of
the period.</p>

  </div>

<p>Of the painters employed at Caughley, it will be sufficient to say that
amongst those apprenticed there were John Parker, Thomas Fennell, and
Henry Boden, famous for their skill in flowers; and that Muss, Silk,
and others, excelled in landscapes and figures—some sepia landscapes
being remarkable for their pure artistic treatment; while among the
gilders, a most important art, and one to which special attention has
always been directed at these works, were men of the names of Rutland,
Marsh, and Randall who were considered proficients. Of the latter, a
nephew, who is the author of pleasant little volumes on the “Severn
Valley” and “The Willey Country,” is still employed at the Coalport
works, principally on birds.</p>

<p>I have named above that Robert Hancock engraved for Caughley as well as
for Worcester, or at all events that plates of his were printed from at
the former place possibly for the latter. His name appears on one of
the plates as follows:—
<img src="images/image273a.jpg" alt=""
style="height:2em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">
and other plates
are evidently the work of his hand, though without name. I engraved
a curious mark, the monogram RH, anchor, and name of Worcester, in
the account of those works. This I reproduce on Fig. <a href="#image273b">611</a>, and give
another which occurs on a plate from Caughley, with the anchor and the
word Derby, which I introduce for the purpose of comparison, and to
suggest the probability that the place which produced the one with the
word Derby (for whatever reason that may have been done), which was
undoubtedly Caughley, also produced the one with the word Worcester.
The engraved plate, with the anchor and Derby, is a curious one (for a
mug), and represents a landscape—a river, with trees on either side,
swans sailing in the foreground, behind them two fishermen in a boat
drawing a net, beyond them a boat with sails, and in the background a
bridge, and church with ruins to the left, and a tall gabled building
on the right, over which are the words “Sutton Hall,” whilst above the
whole picture is “English Hospitality.”</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Coalport.</h3>

<p>One of the most flourishing, most important, and most successful in
art-productions of any in the kingdom are the Coalport works, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span> one
time also known as “Coalbrook Dale,” to whose history I now devote
a few pages. The founder of these works was Mr. John Rose, a man of
wondrous skill and enterprise, to whom the ceramic art is indebted for
many important improvements. Mr. Rose, who was the son of a farmer
in the neighbourhood of Caughley, was apprenticed to Mr. Thomas
Turner, of the Caughley China Works, by whom he was taken into the
house, and taught the art of china making in all its branches. Here
he remained for several years; but ultimately, from causes which it
is not necessary to enter upon, a difference arose between them, and
Mr. Rose left Mr. Turner, and commenced a small business on his own
account at Jackfield, in the immediate neighbourhood. Here he did not
remain long, but removed his works to Coalport, on the opposite bank
of the Severn, where he fixed himself in some buildings which had
previously been a small pottery belonging to a Mr. Young, a mercer
of Shrewsbury, and in these buildings in part they have continued to
the present day. Mr. John Rose had not long established himself at
Coalport, it appears, before he met with opposition; for other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span> works
were started on the opposite side of the canal, and only a few yards
distant, by his brother, Mr. Thomas Rose, and partners, who commenced
business under the style of “Anstice, Horton, and Rose.” These works,
however, did not continue long, but passed into the hands of Mr.
John Rose and his partners, who, with other additions, formed them
into one establishment. In the space of three or four years from the
establishment of the Coalport works by Mr. Rose, he had so successfully
carried on his business that the Caughley works of Mr. Turner had
become greatly reduced, and were gradually beaten out of the market. In
1799 Mr. Turner, of the Caughley works, gave up the business and sold
the concern to Messrs. Rose &amp; Co., who thus became proprietors of both
works, as well as of those commenced by the brother of Mr. Rose. Both
manufactories were then continued by them, thus giving a great increase
to the establishment, and rendering it one of the most extensive in the
kingdom.</p>

<p>In 1803 Messrs. Blakeway, Rose, and Horton having become bankrupt,
a question as to the ownership of the remainder of the Caughley
manufactory arose and was submitted to arbitration. The following is
the award, for which I am indebted to my friend Mr. Hubert Smith:—</p>

<p>On the 23rd October, 1799, an event occurred in connection with the
works at Coalport which was most sad in its results. At that time a
considerable number of the work-people and painters employed at the
works resided at Broseley, and were in the habit of passing backwards
and forwards across a ferry near the works. On this night, thirty-two
persons, including the best artists, went on board the ferry-boat,
which, about midwater, owing to the intoxicated state of the ferryman,
was capsized, and twenty-nine were drowned. The principal painter at
this time was an artist named Walker, and an unfinished piece of work
of his—the piece he left in progress only a few minutes before he
lost his life—is still preserved, with almost religious care, in the
factory.</p>

<p>Soon after this time considerable additions were made at Coalport,
and since then the manufactory has been constantly and considerably
enlarged, and now occupies, I am told, considerably more ground than
any other porcelain works in the kingdom.</p>

<p>The view of the Coalport China Works given on page 274 will show its
extensive character in the early part of the present century, and its
pleasant situation on the banks of the Severn. The view is copied from
an interesting painting by Muss, who, before his successful artistic
career in London, was employed as one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span> painters at this
establishment. Since the period when Muss made this painting, the works
have been constantly increased, and at the present time are about
doubled in extent.</p>

<p>The commercial style of the firm has been, ever since its establishment
at Coalport, and still is, “Messrs. John Rose and Company,” although
many changes in the proprietary have taken place. These changes have
been as follows:—“Rose and Blakeway;” “Rose, Blakeway, and Rose;”
“Rose, Johnson, and Winter;” “Rose, Johnson, Clarke, and Winter;”
“Rose, Winter, and Clarke;” “Rose, Clarke, and Maddison;” “Maddison,
Pugh, Rose, and Rose;” “W. Pugh and W. F. Rose;” and the present sole
proprietor is “William Pugh;” but the firm is still known by its old
style of “John Rose and Co.” Mr. John Rose died in 1841, and was buried
at Barrow. He was succeeded by his nephew, Mr. W. F. Rose, of Rock
House, Coalport, who retired from the firm in the autumn of 1862, and
died in London in 1864, having in the meantime started some small works
at Hanley, where he shortly afterwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span> failed, and unsuccessfully
attempted to commence others in Derbyshire. He was a man of the most
generous disposition and kindly nature, and his losses were a subject
of deep sorrow to myself and his other many friends.</p>

<p>It will be seen from what I have said, that the Coalport works had
already, before the commencement of the present century, absorbed
those of Caughley, of Jackfield, and of the opposition establishment
of Messrs. Anstice, Horton, and Rose. Some years later, the Swansea
Porcelain Works, which had risen somewhat into repute, were
discontinued, and the moulds, &amp;c, bought by Mr. Rose, who removed them,
along with the workmen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span> to Coalport, about the year 1820. Another
famed manufactory, though small, that of Nantgarw, established by
Billingsley, the famous flower painter, of Derby, and his son-in-law,
Walker, also of Derby, in 1816 (under the assumed name of <i>Beeley</i>
and Walker), and which produced, perhaps, the finest examples of
porcelain with granulated fracture ever made, also soon afterwards
was merged into the Coalport establishment. Billingsley and Walker,
on discontinuing the works at Nantgarw, removed to Coalport, with
all their moulds and processes, and continued employed there until
Billingsley’s death, which took place in 1828. Walker was a remarkably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
clever workman, and did much during the time of his continuance at
Coalport to improve the art of china-making. He removed thence to
America, where he established a pottery, which, I believe, he still
continues to work. The Nantgarw porcelain was very expensive to make,
but was remarkably fine in its body and texture. The original recipes
for this peculiar body are in the possession of Messrs. Rose &amp; Co.;
and it can be made at Coalport of as fine a quality as ever. I have
carefully examined specimens made <i>at</i> Nantgarw with others made
by Billingsley and Walker when they first came to Coalport, and these
again with examples made by Messrs. Rose in 1860, and they appear all
to be of equal excellence of body. It is, however, too expensive a
process to be followed to any extent, and is never manufactured there
now.</p>

<p>In 1820 Mr. John Rose received the gold medal of the Society of Arts
for his improvements in the manufacture of china. The prize, which
was offered for the best porcelain glaze produced without lead,
was competed for by Copelands, Davenports, and all the principal
manufacturers, as well as by Mr. Rose, but was honourably gained by
him. It bears the inscription—“To Mr. John Rose, <span class="allsmcap">MDCCCXX.</span>,
for his improved glaze for porcelain.”</p>

<p>The history of the works has been one of complete success from
their first establishment to the present day; and this success has
been attained by untiring and unflagging energy on the part of the
proprietary, and by a determination to make their manufactory second
to none in existence in extent and in beauty and purity of work. The
porcelain trade owes much to the ability and energy of Mr. John Rose;
and this skill, ability, and energy is equally the characteristic of
the present proprietor, Mr. Pugh.</p>

<p>Both at the Great Exhibition in 1851 and that of 1862, as well as at
the French Exhibition in 1855, Messrs. Rose &amp; Co. carried off medals
for their productions; and these recognitions of excellence have
been continued at the later International Exhibitions. At the first
a magnificent dessert service in the difficult but truly beautiful
<i>Rose du Barry</i> colour, which the firm had succeeded in restoring
in all its beauty to the ceramic art, was exhibited, and excited
considerable interest. This service, considered by competent judges
to equal the original Sèvres in evenness of colour, was purchased by
Lord Ashburton. At the second, Messrs. Rose exhibited a large number of
exquisite examples of their make; and services were purchased by the
Emperor of the French, by M. Fould, and by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span> principal <i>savans</i>
of Paris. At the third, the selection of vases and other decorative
pieces was of the finest possible character.</p>

<p>At the present hour the productions of the Coalport works take a
foremost rank among the best porcelain of the kingdom; many of the
specialities of this firm being marvels of beauty; the colours pure
and full, and of extreme richness. Sardinian green—a colour for the
extreme depth and richness of which these works are celebrated—is
introduced with remarkable effect both in services and otherwise. One
of the finest pieces of this colour is a tripod wine goblet, with
flowers in tablets, and raised and jewelled gold borders. A lighter
shade of this fine green is introduced, with tablets of flowers and
Westbourne birds, with great effect on two-handled goblets, &amp;c. <i>Rose
du Barry</i> has always been a speciality of the Coalport works, and a
colour on the excellence of which its proprietors, especially the late
clever and enlightened Mr. W. F. Rose, have always prided themselves.
This is used as a ground in every conceivable variety of decoration,
and when enriched with raised dead and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span> burnished gold, and with the
exquisite painting by which it is usually accompanied, has a remarkably
rich and chaste effect. A new jardinière, with pierced key top and
Sèvres fruit and flowers, is one of the prettiest examples of this
colour, combined with raised gold and flowers, which has been produced.
One of the finest and most massive pieces in this colour is a claret
jug, with raised gold vine-leaves and grapes and other decorations,
and splendidly painted on one side with the head of a bacchante and on
the other a bunch of grapes. A pink, or light <i>Rose du Barry</i>,
is also much used as a ground for pilgrims’ bottles, vases, services,
&amp;c., where, for some kinds of decoration, it harmonizes better than
the full colour would. A blue with a slightly purplish cast, which
gives it an additional richness and fulness, has been introduced, and
forms a splendid ground for Japanese decoration in vases, pilgrims’
bottles, &amp;c., in which style of now very fashionable decoration
the Coalport artists excel. In these Japanese patterns some of the
designs are unusually elaborate and intricate, and the workmanship is
characterized by extreme precision and regularity, while the gilding
and colour, especially the deep reds and blues, are rich and full in
the extreme. Some of the vases in this style vie with those of the
native art of the Japanese, and are not excelled by any other house.
The principal artists employed at the present time at the works are
Mr. Charles Palmere, Mr. Cooke, Mr. John Randall, Mr. Birbeck, Mr.
A. Bowdler, Mr. J. Hartshorne, and Mr. Jabez Aston; and among those
formerly engaged here was Mr. R. F. Abraham, a student of Antwerp
and Paris and a successful follower of the school of Etty. Modellers
of a very high class in their respective branches are also employed,
and the excellence of their work is apparent in all the higher class
productions of this establishment.</p>

<p>The marks used by the Caughley works have already been fully
described.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> After the removal of these works to Coalport, the same
letters, both C and S, for many years were used. At Coalport, however,
marks have been adopted, perhaps, more sparingly than at any other
works; and the great bulk of the goods have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span> manufactured, from
the first down to the present time, without any mark at all. On some
examples of the early part of the present century, the written name of
“Coalport,” thus—<i>Coalport</i>
<img src="images/image287a.jpg" alt=""
style="height:2em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">
—appears; but these
are of very rare occurrence. Another mark, adopted somewhat later,
though only used very sparingly, was simply the letters
<img src="images/image287b.jpg" alt=""
style="height:2em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">
for Coalbrookdale, or the same two letters
conjoined thus—
<img src="images/image287c.jpg" alt=""
style="height:2.5em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">
sometimes
also Coalbrookdale appears in full, and at others the contraction “C
Dale,” in similar writing letters.</p>

<p>Another mark, adopted in 1820, was of large size, and will, perhaps,
be as well understood by description as engraving. It is a circle of
nearly two inches diameter, in which is a wreath of laurel encircling
the words, “Coalport Improved Felt Spar Porcelain,” in four lines
across. Surrounding the wreath are the words, “Patronised by the
Society of Arts. The Gold Medal awarded May 30, 1820;” while beneath,
and outside the circle, is the name “I. Rose and Co.” This mark was
adopted consequent on Mr. John Rose obtaining the Society of Arts’ gold
medal for “his improved glaze for porcelain” to which I have before
alluded, and the articles on which it appears are of extremely good
material and very perfect glaze.</p>

<p>Other marks adopted by this firm, although but seldom used (the great
bulk of the goods, as I have said before, being sent out without
any mark at all), are the following:—
<img src="images/image287d.jpg" alt=""
style="height:3em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">
The first of these is a monogram of the letters C B D, for
Coalbrookdale, so joined together as to produce a very characteristic
and distinctive mark. The second, the same monogram, surrounded by a
garter bearing the name of “Daniell, London”—a firm for many years,
like Mortlocks and other leading houses, connected with Coalport or
Coalbrookdale, who have had that mark used for some especial orders.
The third and last is the most recent mark, and is almost the only one
now used by the Coalport works: it embraces the initials of the various
manufactories which have from time to time been incorporated with,
or merged into, the Coalport establishment. Thus the scroll—which
at first sight may, to the uninitiated, look like a short “and”
(&amp;)—will, on examination, be seen to be a combination of the writing
letters, C and S, for <i>Coalport</i> and <i>Salopian</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span> enclosing
within its bows the three letters, C, S, and N, denoting respectively
<i>Caughley</i>, <i>Swansea</i>, and <i>Nantgarw</i>.</p>

<p>Having now passed through the history of these famed works, and shown
their connection with others, both in manufacture and in printing, it
only remains to say a few words on the varieties of goods for which
the Salopian works have been famed, both in times past and at present.
First and foremost, then, of course, come the blue painted and printed
wares copied from Chinese patterns, for which both it and the early
Worcester works were remarkable. The first painted, as well as printed,
wares were close imitations of the foreign; but groups of flowers of
original design, &amp;c., were also introduced, and designs <i>based</i>,
perhaps, on foreign models were adopted. Groups of figures, in the
characteristic costume of the period, were also executed with great
taste and ability. Of the Chinese patterns, the two most famous—the
well-known “willow pattern” (known generally among the trade as the
“Broseley pattern”) and the “blue dragon” (also known as the “Broseley
blue dragon”)—owe their first introduction to the Caughley works; and
this fact alone is sufficient to entitle them to more than ordinary
notice. The willow pattern has undoubtedly been the most popular,
and had the most extensive sale of any pattern ever introduced. It
has, of course, been made by most houses, but the credit of its first
introduction belongs to Caughley; and early examples, bearing the
Caughley mark—the cups without handles, and ribbed and finished
precisely like the foreign—are rare. The dragon, known still as “the
Broseley blue dragon” or “Broseley blue Canton,” was also a most
successful imitation of the Chinese, and almost rivalled the “willow”
in popularity. A special form of jug, considered in those days to be
very far advanced in art, known technically as the “cabbage-leaf jug,”
was also first made at the Caughley works.</p>

<p>Later on, the “worm sprig” pattern, the “tournay sprig,” and other
equally successful patterns were here introduced from the Dresden, as
were also the celebrated Dresden raised flowers and the “Berlin chain
edge” pattern. About 1821 a peculiar marone-coloured ground, which is
much sought after, was introduced at Coalport, by Walker, of Nantgarw,
of whom I have before spoken; and at this time many marked improvements
were made in the different processes of manufacture.</p>

<p>The copies, both in embossing, in body, in colour, and oiliness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
the glaze, and in style of painting of birds and flowers, of the
Dresden at this period were perfect, and, as the Dresden mark was
(perhaps injudiciously) introduced as well, were capable of deceiving
even the most knowing connoisseur. It may be well to note that at this
period an <i>impressed</i> anchor was sometimes used. This must not
be taken to be anything more than a workman’s mark. Very successful
copies of the Sèvres and Chelsea have also been at one time or other
produced, and on these the marks of those makers have been also copied.
Collectors of “old Chelsea,” especially of the famous green examples,
must be careful, therefore, not to take everything for granted as
belonging to that place on which the gold anchor is found.</p>

<p>The <i>egg-shell china</i> produced at Coalport is much finer than any
other which has come under my notice, from the fact that the body is
<i>pure porcelain</i>, being composed of one stone and one clay alone,
unmixed with bone or any other material whatever.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Broseley.</h3>

<p><i>Broseley Pipe Works.</i>—Broseley is perhaps more universally known
as a seat of the manufacture of tobacco-pipes than in any other way;
for in this particular it has “held its own” against other localities
for about three centuries, and seems still likely to do so for three
centuries more, should the habit of smoking continue so long. As a
few words must in the course of this work be said upon this branch
of ceramic art, it may be well here to introduce it; and I cannot do
better than give, in an abridged and altered form, what, some years
ago, I drew up for the pages of the <i>Reliquary</i>.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span></p>

<p>The period at which the introduction of tobacco into England took place
is a vexed question, which it is not necessary here to attempt to
solve. To Sir Walter Raleigh, Mr. Ralph Lane (his governor of Virginia,
who returned to England in 1586), Sir John Hawkins (1565), Captain
Price, Captain Keat, and others, have respectively been assigned the
honour of its introduction and of its first use in this country. But,
at whatever period tobacco was introduced, it must not, I think, be
taken for granted that to that period the commencement of the habit of
smoking must be ascribed. It may reasonably be inferred, from various
circumstances, that herbs and leaves of one kind or other were smoked
medicinally, in this country, long before the period at which tobacco
is generally believed to have been first brought to England. Coltsfoot,
yarrow, mouse-ear, and other plants are still smoked by the people,
for various ailments, in rural districts, and are considered highly
efficacious, as well as pleasant; and I have known them smoked through
a stick from which the pith had been removed, the bowl being formed of
a lump of clay rudely fashioned at the time, and baked at the fireside.
I have no doubt that pipes were in use before “the weed” was known in
our country, and that it took the place of other plants, but did not
give rise to the custom of smoking.</p>

<p>It is difficult to assign dates to these early pipes, but the one
represented in Fig. <a href="#image292">645</a> is probably Elizabethan. It bears on its spur
a rose. Mr. Crofton Croker considered that the smaller the pipe,
the more distant its date, and therefore he assigned the diminutive
example shown on Fig. <a href="#image292">648</a>, of its full size, to an early period. This
idea, which originated in the knowledge that tobacco was an extremely
expensive luxury when first imported, and as it gradually decreased in
value allowed a larger indulgence to the smoker, will not, I think,
hold good, for dated examples show that some of the later specimens
are far less capacious than others which are of an undoubtedly earlier
period. The <i>form</i> of the pipe is generally a better criterion
of age than its size, though even this cannot always be depended
upon. Adopting Mr. Croker’s arrangement as to periods, the following
series of examples, partly selected from pipes in my own possession,
will be useful to the collector, and enable him pretty accurately
to appropriate any specimens which may come under his notice. The
engravings are, of course, of a reduced size. Fig. <a href="#image292">649</a> is of similar
form to the one above; it is probably Elizabethan.</p>

<p>The next example Mr. Croker assigned to the period of James I.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
or Charles I. It does not differ very materially in shape from the
preceding specimens. Of pipes of this period, a large variety of shapes
might be adduced. These forms may be understood from the figures in the
accompanying group, copied from engravings of the period. The dates
are, No. 1, 1630; 2, 1632; 3, 1640; 4, 1641. The latter example is
of the same shape as those known to have been in use in the reign of
Elizabeth, and is pretty nearly similar to Mr. Croker’s example. The
same form is found in use through several reigns. The usual shape of
the period, however, will be seen on Figs. <a href="#image002">1</a>, <a href="#image003a">2</a>, and <a href="#image003b">3</a>.</p>

<p>The barrel-shaped pipe, engraved as an example of the period comprising
the Commonwealth and the reign of Charles II., is from Devonshire,
and may be taken as the usual type of that era. Of this period, the
examples given are chosen principally from Traders’ tokens. One (2)
will be seen to be of the form usually ascribed to William III.’s
reign. The dates of these specimens are 1, 1650; 2, 1666 (Dunstable);
3, 1688 (Chipping Norton); 4, probably same year (Southwark); 5, 1669
(Leeds). Pipes were made at Leeds from a peculiar vein of clay found
there.</p>

<p>Mr. Croker considered the pipes of the reign of William III. to have
had bowls of the elongated form (Figs. <a href="#image292">662 and 663</a>), and it would
appear probable that this is correct, for at the places where his
Dutch troops were stationed, the pipes of this and the accompanying
form are most abundant. Barrel-shaped bowls were, however, still in
use, and I have copied one from Mr. Fairholt’s book, on which the
date 1689 is incised. That these long pipes were not imported in very
large quantities, may be gleaned from the following highly interesting
notice, which I quote from Houghton:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The next are <i>tobacco-pipes</i>, of which came from
<i>Holland</i>, gross one hundred and ten, chests four. I have
seen some very long ones and also small from thence, that truly
are very fine. If there comes no more, they’ll do us no great
hurt. I think they must be permitted to be patterns to set our
people on work, and if our smoakers would use none but fine
ones, I question not but we should make as fine as anybody.”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>
</div>

<p>From this it appears that, in 1694, only 110 gross, or four chests,
of Dutch pipes were imported, and this included both sorts—the “very
long ones and also small.” It is worthy of note, for comparison’s sake,
that in the same year from Holland 12,000, and from Germany 23 tons, of
“marbles for boys to play with,” were imported.</p>

  </div>

<p>The long-bowled pipes continued in use to the middle of last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span> century,
and representations of them may be found on engravings of the period,
thus showing that they gradually merged from the bulbous into the
elongated form of the time of William III., and so passed on to the
wide-mouthed shape of the present day. The heel or spur also changed
from the flat form—made to rest the pipe upon during or after use—to
the long pointed one now so common, and which took its rise probably
from the Dutch. It must be remembered, however, that the Dutch were
originally indebted to England for the introduction of pipe-making into
that country.</p>

<p>Usually the old pipes were perfectly plain, with the general exception
of a milled border, impressed by hand, not in the mould, running round
the mouth. It is also worthy of remark, that the bowls of many of the
older pipes are <i>scraped</i> into form after having been moulded.
Sometimes ornamented examples are met with, but they are of extremely
rare occurrence. Mr. Croker had one which he considered to have been
of foreign make, but which I think there is little doubt is of English
manufacture: and the one in my own possession (Fig. <a href="#image292">646</a>) presents some
very interesting features; in form it closely resembles one of the
examples of James I. and Charles I., and I have no doubt, from the form
of the letters, that I am right in appropriating it to that period.</p>

<p>It is not very easy to localise pipes, for but little is known of
places where they were made, and the manufacture was of course of so
small an extent that it is difficult to trace it. In November, 1601,
<i>Mr. Secretary Cecil</i> alludes, in a speech, to a then existing
patent of monopoly enjoyed by tobacco-pipe makers; and in 1619 the
craft of pipemakers were incorporated, their privileges, according
to Stowe, extending through the cities of London and Westminster,
the kingdom of England, and dominion of Wales. They were governed
by a master, four wardens, and about twenty-four assistants. These
privileges were confirmed by subsequent monarchs. At Derby several
generations of pipemakers have uninterruptedly carried on business, and
it was in one of these ovens that the first pieces of Derby china were
fired. The pipes made at Winchester were, in Ben Jonson’s time, great
favourites; they were said to be the best then made, and far superior
to those of Vauxhall and other places. In the neighbourhood of Bath,
pipes were apparently made in the beginning of the seventeenth century,
the makers’ names being Thomas Hunt, Henry Putley, Rich. Greenland,
Rich. Tyler, and Jeffry Hunt; and some of the examples bear a shield
with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span> a branch of the tobacco-plant. At Lichfield they were made to a
large extent, as also at Newcastle-under-Lyme, and indeed they were
produced in most parts of the country.</p>

<p>From the smallness of size of these early pipes has, I presume, arisen
their common name of “Fairy Pipes,” varied sometimes into “Elfin
Pipes,” “Mab Pipes,” “Danes Pipes,” etc. They are also sometimes called
“Celtic” and “Old Man’s Pipes,” and I have heard them designated by
the characteristic name of “Carls Pipes,” a name indicative of a
belief in their ancient origin.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> In Ireland, they are believed to
have belonged to the <i>Cluricanes</i>, a kind of wild, mischievous
fairy-demon, and when found are at once broken up by the superstitious
“pisantry.” In England, they are said to have belonged to the fairies
or “old men,” but, unlike their Irish brethren, our peasantry usually
preserve them, and in some districts believe that a certain amount
of good luck attends their possession. I have known one of these
pipes carried about the person for years, and have heard its owner—a
Peak-man—declare in his native dialect, on being asked to part with
it, “Nay, a’d part wi’ a towth sowner!” A quantity of these “fairy
pipes” were found in the parish of Old Swinford, Worcestershire, some
few years ago, “and the country folks there had a tradition that it
was a favourite spot for the resort of Queen Mab and her court, and
that among other appendages of royalty was a fairy-pipe manufactory, of
which these were the remains.”</p>

<p>Broseley has been so long famous for its tobacco-pipes, that a
“Broseley” is a term familiar to smokers all over the world. That this
locality should have been chosen as the place <i>par excellence</i> for
their manufacture, is to be accounted for by the excellent clay of the
district.</p>

<p>The white pottery found at Wroxeter is made of clay from the Severn
Valley, and this shows that the Broseley or other clays were worked at
a very early period of our history. The Shirlot clay, of which a few
pipes were made at Shirlot and Much-Wenlock, is of a coarse texture,
and very inferior to the Devon pipeclay, of which most are now made.
This might lead us to suppose that the earliest manufacturers of pipes
<i>at first used the clay found in the neighbourhood</i>, but discarded
it for the purer clays which they obtained from Devonshire; but I
feel assured the Shirlot and Wenlock pipes are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span> not of very ancient
date. In the late Mr. Thursfield’s collection were many with marks on
the spur. Some of these marks exhibit the maker’s name in full, some
abbreviated, others initials only, and one has a gauntlet on the bowl,
with S. D. (probably the initials of Samuel Decon, who was alive in
1729) on the spur; three bowls alone only bear dates, viz., Richard
Legg, 1687; John Legg, 1687; and John Legg, 1696. These three are
engraved on page 293. “I have carefully examined the Broseley parish
register,” Mr. Thursfield informed me, “which dates back as early as
1572, and find in 1575, 17th Elizabeth (ten years before Sir Walter
Raleigh introduced tobacco), that Richard Legg had a daughter baptized.
I therefore consider him to be the father of Broseley pipemakers, for
even at the present day some of his descendants follow the trade in
this place—from various causes no longer as masters—and still bear
the family names of Richard and John Legg. A stone slab let into the
front of a substantial cottage, with the words ‘Richard Legg built
this, 1716,’ testifies to the well-to-do position held by the family in
the early part of the eighteenth century.” The name of Ben Legg also
occurs on a pipe found in Worcestershire. The names of the pipemakers
at Broseley, judging from the examples I have seen, appear to commence
first as follows:—Clarke in 1647, Roden in 1681, Legg 1575, Darbey
1700, Decon 1608, Evans 1615, Hughes 1641, Hartshorne 1620, James 1600,
Jones 1590, Price 1608, Partridge 1718, Overton 1700, Smith 1709, Shaw
1630, Wilksone 1733, and Ward 1700. Other names (Brown, Bradley, Dry,
Hart, Harper, Overley, and Roberts, for instance) occur as pipemakers
here in the olden time.</p>

<p>More than a hundred years ago, the pipemakers began to stamp their
names and residences on the <i>stems</i> of the pipes instead of the
spurs, the stems being, in many instances, 16 or 18 inches or more in
length. They likewise made a small twist or bead mid stem, at such a
length from the bowl, that when held between the fingers at that spot,
the pipe was balanced.</p>

<p>A pipe-maker, named Noah Roden, brought the long pipes to great
perfection, and supplied most of the London clubs and coffee-houses
of that day; he died about 1829, and his business was carried on by
the late William Southorn, who made great strides in improving the
manufacture, and whose eldest son is now carrying on the famed business
of maker of the patent and genuine “Real Broseleys.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span></p>

<p>About the middle of last century, and since, the Rodens were famous
makers of pipes at Broseley, and to them is due the introduction of
“churchwardens” and “London straws,” and they were succeeded in the
early part of this century by Mr. Southorn, father of the present
well-known maker, Mr. Edwin Southorn. The works at present carried on
by Mr. Edwin Southorn were established about 1830 by Noah Roden. In
1856 they passed into the hands of Mr. Southorn, and from that time
forward their progress has been of marked improvement in every branch
of the manufacture. In 1860 Mr. Southorn introduced the process of
transfer printing upon pipes, the same as practised in other branches
of ceramics. By this means the crests or armorial bearings, names,
mottoes, or monograms of his patrons, trade marks or initials of firms,
and signs and names of hotels and inns are produced, as are also other
devices in colours. In 1868 Mr. Southorn introduced steam-power into
his manufactory, and has rendered it available to all parts of his
works; he is thus enabled to produce an enormous quantity, counting
at the present time about 10,500 gross or 1,500,000 pipes in the
course of a year. The “Broseleys” thus, not only in quantity but in
quality—for they are the finest produced both in form, in quality of
clay, in beauty of surface, and in manipulation of any made—surpass
all others. In 1851, Mr. Southorn received honourable mention as
“superior tobacco-pipes” at the Exhibition in that year. Mr. Southorn
has also introduced the plan of dipping, or “tipping,” his pipes at the
mouth-piece with green or any other coloured glaze, which is one of the
most marked improvements of modern days.</p>

<p>The variety of pipes produced at these works is somewhat remarkable.
Among these are “large bowls,” 21 inches long; “long plain,” 22
inches long; “long Broseley straws,” or “aldermen,” 27 inches long,
“fit for an alderman or a king;” “long straws,” or “churchwardens,”
25 inches long, which Dr. Richardson, at the Bath meeting of the
British Association, says are unquestionably the best of pipes;
“London straws,” 16 inches; “Raleigh straws,” “Lord Crewes,” 27 inches
long; “long Dutch straws,” 28 inches long; “short Broseley straws,”
“short tips,” “plain tips,” “S. D. straws,” “dhudeens,” “peg-top
straws,” “ovarium straws,” “billiard,” “cutty,” “yachting,” “Broseley
meerschaums,” and a score of other kinds. One of the specialities,
however, of Mr. Southorn’s productions is his “patent Broseley
Narghilé.” In this “the pipe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span> which is formed of clay noted for its
fineness and remarkably porous qualities, is enclosed for a portion
of its length in a glass tube, which is filled with water; and the
action of the water is to draw away the colouring matter and narcotic
poison from the smoke before reaching the smoker’s mouth. The proof of
this is in the gradual colouring of the water; which may be readily
discharged and the tube refilled. A further effect is coolness of the
extremity. The glass tubes are supplied from the Broseley pipe works
in every variety of style, and we have never seen so much fine art
taste combined with utility as in these, some of them vieing with the
ancient Venetian glass in the combination of opaque and clear, &amp;c. It
is to be understood that by the ‘Narghilé’ is meant the attachment,
or tube containing water, which is removable at the pleasure of
the holder; a title that serves to recall the luxurious and costly
water-pipes of Turkey, to which, in all their best qualities, this
patent completely answers. The ‘patent’ Broseley pipe is manufactured
specially for the Narghilé, and is the only clay pipe for which it is
adapted. It is evident that a clay, either more or less porous than
are these tobacco-pipes, would be equally unsuitable; and what is very
remarkable, and shows the perfection to which the manufacture has been
carried, these pipes are uniform in porousness, in part due to their
being manufactured of the very finest and purest clay.”</p>

<p>Many of the forms adopted by Mr. Southorn are adaptations of mediæval
examples, and others are of the most artistic and elegant outline. The
mark used by him is usually the name “<span class="allsmcap">E. SOUTHORN, BROSELEY</span>,”
impressed on the stem. Sometimes his name with the royal arms appears
printed on the bowl.</p>

<p>The other pipemakers at Broseley at the present day are Mr. William
Southorn, of the late firm of William Southorn and Co.; and Richard
Tomkis; but of these it is not necessary to speak.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Coalbrookdale.</h3>

<p>The terra cotta works belonging to the world-famed “Coalbrookdale Iron
Company” were established in 1861. The beds of clay belonging to this
company being peculiarly adapted for the finest and best kinds of
terra cotta, they, in conjunction with others in the neighbourhood,
undertook to prepare and send, for the Exhibition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span> of 1862, examples
of goods made from the various clays of the Shropshire coal fields.
The result of this determination was the establishment of this branch
of the company’s manufacture, and, so far as it has been carried out,
it has proved eminently successful. The colour of the terra cotta is
a peculiarly light buff of a pleasing and soft tint; and the quality
is of the highest order both for firmness, fineness, hardness, and
durability. In it the company produce vases, tazzas, pedestals,
brackets, pendants, flower-pots and boxes, chimney-pots, and every
variety of architectural decoration. With their well-known skill in
design, and with the talented artists they employ for their metal work,
it may well be supposed that this company would produce striking and
beautiful patterns in their vases and other ornamental goods; and such
is the case. There is a peculiar sharpness and beauty in the details of
many that is far superior to that produced by some other firms. Some of
the designs will be seen in the accompanying engravings.</p>

<p>At Lightmoor, in the same neighbourhood, the Coalbrookdale Company have
extensive works for the manufacture of moulded and other bricks in
white, blue, and red clays; ornamental and plain roofing tiles, many
of which are of very effective shapes; garden edgings and ridge tiles
of every style of design, from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span> simple bead to an elaborate Tudor
ornament; paving tiles, &amp;c. Nothing could better show the variety, the
importance, and the high quality of the clays of this locality than do
these varieties. The colour of the red quarries is rich, and improves
with washing and wear, while their hardness is beyond any others. The
roof tiles of this company are very extensively used (for instance, the
Charterhouse Schools, near Godalming, are covered with them), and they
have the reputation of being among the hardest and best produced.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Madeley.</h3>

<p>A small manufactory of china was established and carried on for
about a quarter of a century at Madeley, by Mr. Martin Randall, who
served his apprenticeship at the Coalport works; his elder brothers,
Edward and William Randall, having been apprenticed at Caughley.
From Coalport Martin Randall went to the Derby China Works, where he
remained for some time, and became the friend of two of their famed
painters, Phillip Cleve and William Pegg. From Derby he removed to
London, and entered into business with a Mr. Robins, at Islington.
Upon a dissolution of partnership he came down to Madeley, and fixed
himself in Park Place, where for a few years he confined himself to
re-decorating Sèvres china, which was procured by agents; chiefly of
Baldock and Garman, in Paris. White china was obtained where feasible;
but when that could not be had, dessert, tea, and breakfast services,
vases, wine coolers, jardinières, and other articles, ornamented simply
with blue and gold lines, dots, or sprigs of flowers, were purchased;
the latter of which were removed by fluoric acid, the glaze being so
blended with the body that it gave back a new surface on being passed
through the enamelling kiln. The gold was so thick on the pieces that
it was usually peeled off with a knife, and was then sent to London
to be again reduced by acid. At first Randall used a box<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span> kiln, with
charcoal; but afterwards erected an enamelling kiln, which he heated
with billets of wood.</p>

<p>Mr. Randall soon afterwards removed from Park Lane to a larger house
at the bottom of Madeley, where he erected enamelling kilns, and also
a kiln which served for biscuit and glaze. His potters were Thomas
Wheeler, who was thrower and turner; Francis Brewer, modeller; William
Roberts, presser; and David Morris, fire-man. Mr. John Randall,
nephew of Mr. T. M. Randall, was an apprentice to the painting, and
Mr. Francis Brewer, now of the Tamworth Potteries, was an apprentice
to the modelling. Mr. Randall took the decorating department, but he
also employed as figure painter Mr. Philip Ballard, a son of Mr. S.
Ballard, solicitor, Worcester, and brother to Mr. T. Ballard, R.A. Mr.
R. B. Gray, artist, now of Dorking, and father of Mr. George Gray,
A.R.A., and his son Robert were flower painters; and the late Mr.
Enos Raby was ground-layer, colour-maker, and gilder. Mr. Randall’s
want of experience in the processes of making led to frequent errors
and losses, the latter being the greater from his constant desire to
produce a body which should equal Nantgarrw and Sèvres. “Too much
beer” on the part of a fire-man sometimes brought down the entire
kiln of ware, so that the saggers disappeared below the trial-hole,
and the pieces bulged like wax, till they became fast to each other,
and assumed the most fantastic forms. Too much flint in the clay,
at another time, produced a chalky absorbent body, that drank up so
much glaze that when fired it would fly off in the form of small
daggers whilst cooling, and continue to do so for weeks. Mr. Randall,
however, kept his temper like a philosopher; and at length succeeded
in producing the nearest approach to the old Sèvres of any at that
time made in this kingdom. It had all the mellow transparency and
richness, and the same capability of receiving the colours into the
glaze, of that famous ware, and had this to such an extent that the
most experienced connoisseurs found it impossible to distinguish
between them, excepting by the mark, which no bribe would induce him
to imitate; being a strict quaker, he had a conscientious objection to
doing so. From Madeley, Mr. Randall removed his business to Shelton;
and here it was that the late Mr. Herbert Minton was so struck with the
beauty of his productions that he made overtures to him to join his
firm, which, however, he did not do; and he soon afterwards retired
from business, and went to live at Barlaston, near Trentham, where he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
died, and was buried in a spot he had chosen for himself. Mr. Randall,
who was uncle to Mr. John Randall, F.G.S., one of the celebrated
painters of the Coalport works, used no mark.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Jackfield.</h3>

<p>The Jackfield Pottery was one of the oldest in Shropshire, and is
believed to have been worked for centuries. The potters had, at
different times, probably from being expert hands, migrated into
Staffordshire; and I am informed that, as early as 1560, several
entries occur in the parish registers of Stoke-upon-Trent of people
(potters, of course) as “<i>from Jackfield</i>.” A few years ago a
coal-pit at Jackfield, which was known not to have been entered for
nearly two centuries, was opened, and in it was found a small mug of
brown earthenware, bearing the date 1634. The works were, probably not
long after this period, carried on by a person of the name of Glover,
who used the old salt glaze for his ware. He was succeeded by Mr. John
Thursfield, son of Mr. John Thursfield of Stoke-upon-Trent, about the
year 1713. This John Thursfield had married a daughter of Captain Webb,
who had been in the wars under Marlborough and Prince Eugene, and
had, while in the Low Countries, married a Dutch lady. In 1729 John
Thursfield married a lady named Eleanor Morris, of Ferney Bank, who is
curiously described in the Broseley register as a “sojoinner.” He died
in 1751, leaving two sons—John, who built the works at Benthall; and
Morris, who succeeded his father at Jackfield. The kind of ware made
at Jackfield was a white stoneware, very similar to the Staffordshire
make, and on some examples flowers and other ornaments were incised and
coloured, that is, the outlines were cut in while the clay was soft,
and the flowers and other ornaments touched afterwards with colour.
Tiles of the kind usually known as “Dutch tiles” were also made. In
1763 Mr. Simpson carried on the pottery at Jackfield, and made yellow
ware, and a ware the body of which was pipeclay and glazed with salt.
This he sent down the Severn to the Bristol Channel for export to
America—a trade which the American war of independence put an end to.
Maurice Thursfield made at Jackfield a very superior black ware, highly
vitrified and glazed; indeed, so highly glazed was it that it had all
the outward appearance of glass. The forms, and the potting of these
articles, locally known as “black decanters,” were remarkably good, and
on some specimens which I have seen ornaments have been judiciously
introduced. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span> one, in the possession of the late Richard Thursfield,
Esq., of Broseley, a head and wreath are executed in gold and colour;
and on others, paintings in oils, both portraits and views, and raised
ornaments, are introduced. Some good examples are preserved in the
Museum of Practical Geology. Maurice Thursfield died in America, where
he had, it appears, considerable business connections.</p>

<p>In these works Mr. Rose, in conjunction with a Mr. Blakeway, soon after
the death of Maurice Thursfield, began making china. The works were
not, however, carried on long, but were removed to Coalport, on the
opposite side of the Severn, where they were begun in some buildings
which had formerly been a pottery (I believe belonging to a Mr. Young,
a mercer of Shrewsbury), and where they have continued uninterruptedly
to the present day.</p>

<p>In the early part of this century a pottery—spoken of in 1836 as the
“new pottery”—was established here by Mr. John Myatt, for brown and
yellow stone-wares. Here, too, at the same time, near the Calcuts,
extensive brick and tile-works were then and still are carried on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackfield Encaustic Tiles.</span>—Many years ago Mr. Peter Stephan
(still at this date a modeller at Coalport), son of Stephan the potter,
who was a Frenchman, and at one time at Derby and afterwards of
Jackfield, where he had a small pottery, produced some strikingly good
arabesque patterns in blue printing. His mark was an anchor with cable,
impressed in the body of the ware; and also the crest of an anchor on
an heraldic roll, with his name above (see Figs. <a href="#image305">683 and 684</a>), and
printed in blue on the bottom of the ware. His pieces are of rare
occurrence. He also made encaustic tiles. These were the first made in
this district.</p>

<p><i>The Jackfield Works.</i>—The site of the present works carried
on by Craven, Dunnill, &amp; Co., for the manufacture of Encaustic and
Geometrical tiles, is that of the above old pottery in Jackfield, in
which Hargreaves and Craven for several years made geometrical tiles
by the clay-dust process, and encaustic tiles from plastic clay; but
the buildings being old and dilapidated, Mr. H. P. Dunnill formed a
limited liability company, consisting of seven shareholders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span> for
rebuilding and carrying on the concern. The old buildings were taken
down, a considerable extent of land added to the premises, and on this
land the present handsome new works were erected. They now cover an
extent of nearly two acres of ground, and are fitted with machinery
and arrangements specially adapted to the requirements of the trade,
each department succeeding the other in perfect rotation; so that the
clay goes into the blunging-house at one point, from thence into the
slip-kilns, mill-room, damping-houses, press-shops, encaustic rooms,
drying-stove, seggar-house, firing and glaze-kilns, sorting-house,
warehouses, packing-room, and finally, having in the various processes
gone the circuit of the manufactory, passes into the railway lurries to
be conveyed to various parts of the kingdom and abroad. The fine clays
of Jackfield and Broseley are largely used in the manufacture, and
within the grounds of the works there is a pit in which, from a depth
of thirty-five yards, is brought up by steam-power a beautiful red
clay, of very fine tone of colour. The firm justly pride themselves on
the colour and quality of their plain tiles; and the hardness of their
buff tiles—a point much desired by the trade—is very noticeable. The
colour and hardness of body of their dove tiles are also very apparent.
In encaustic tiles many beautiful designs by Waterhouse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span> Goldie,
Gibbs, Bentley, and other architects are produced. At the instance
of one of the firm, Mr. A. H. Brown, M.P. for Wenlock, a noticeable
arrangement has been made in the interest of the work-people. Any
profit made after ten per cent. paid to the proprietors is equally
divided between them and the work-people, and the latter have thus
a direct interest to do their work in the best manner, so as to add
to the reputation of the firm. Glazed tiles for hearths, of great
variety and beauty of pattern, are made here, and also glazed wall
tiles in white, cream, celadon, and other tones. The company also
produce majolica tiles of the richest class, with an endless variety of
printed, painted, and art tiles for decorative purposes. The quality
of the tiles is remarkably good; the colours are pure and clear, the
body hard and durable, and the glaze firm. Many of the patterns are of
extreme beauty and excellence. The marks adopted, impressed on the back
of the tiles, are—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benthall Works.</span>—The manufactory of encaustic tiles, mosaics,
and majolica, which has for the last twenty-two years been carried on
by Messrs. Maw, at the Benthall works, near Broseley, was initiated
at Worcester (as named in my account of the works of Mr. St. John in
that city) in the year 1850, where Messrs. Maw commenced experimenting
on the processes of manufacture on the premises formerly occupied by
the Worcester Porcelain Manufactory, when under the hands of Messrs.
Flight and Barr, and afterwards used for the production of encaustic
tiles by my late friend Mr. Fleming St. John and his partners, by whom
the moulds, &amp;c., which had been used by them in the manufacture of
encaustic tiles were sold to Messrs. Maw. These gentlemen at once saw
that a much wider field was open to them in the production of tiles
than had previously been attempted at Worcester. In 1852, Messrs.
Maw, feeling the necessity for carrying on the manufacture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span> in a
neighbourhood which would produce both the coal and the clay, abandoned
the works at Worcester, and removed their moulds, plant, &amp;c., to the
Benthall works, near Broseley, where another seven years was spent
by them in a series of costly experiments with no immediate profit
except the experience gained by which they have subsequently built up
the business. Their first effort was to thoroughly investigate and
experiment upon the clays of the Shropshire coal-field, as well as the
plastic materials found throughout the kingdom, many of which no one
had before attempted to turn to economic account.</p>

<p>The results of these experiments have been illustrated in an extensive
series of specimens of the clays or plastic slates of Great Britain
presented by Mr. Geo. Maw, F.S.A., to the Government Museum of
Practical Geology, in Jermyn Street, and printed in the supplement
to the catalogue by Sir H. De La Beche and Mr. Trenham Reeks. In
1857, after all these years of patient labours, the manufacture was
commenced on a commercial scale, which for several years barely paid
its expenses; but from that time to the present continual additions
have been made to the works to meet the increasing demand for their
productions. In 1871 supplementary works were commenced at the Tuckies,
about two miles from the Benthall works, celebrated as the spot where
the late Lord Dundonald carried on his experiments in the manufacture
of coal-gas.</p>

<p>Messrs. Maw have from the first laid themselves out for applying the
very highest art and architectural talents to their manufactures, and,
in 1856, commissioned Mr. M. D. Wyatt to design a series of patterns of
geometrical mosaic, which were issued as a small lithographed volume
of fourteen pages. This little book, which first established their
reputation as art manufacturers, was subsequently superseded by a much
larger volume, published in 1867, including the designs of Digby Wyatt,
George<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span> Goldie, J. P. Seddon, George E. Street, J. Burgess, and others,
as well as the reproduction of all the best obtainable examples of
ancient tiles, geometrical, and Roman mosaic, majolica, &amp;c.</p>

  </div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span></p>

<p>In 1851 Messrs. Maw began the manufacture of plain tiles, geometrical
mosaic, and the ordinary encaustic tiles of two colours, to which
their productions were for several years limited: but since 1857 their
progress has been marked by the continual grafting on of specialities,
the yearly production of new colours, and new phases of ceramic art
applied to tiles. In 1861 they commenced the manufacture of very small
tesseræ for the formation of pictorial mosaics, and produced for the
Exhibition of 1862 their well-known mosaic of “<i>The Seasons</i>,”
here engraved (Fig. <a href="#image310">695</a>), and which is now in the South Kensington
Museum, from a design expressly made for them by Digby Wyatt. The
result was so successful that Mr. Wyatt commissioned Messrs. Maw to
execute a mosaic frieze for the inner quadrangle of the New India
Office.</p>

<p>The production of coloured enamels for the surface decoration of
majolica tiles next occupied their attention, and after years of
experimenting, all the colours employed in the ancient tiles of Spain
or Italy were successfully reproduced, as well as others which were
unknown to the mediæval and Moorish manufacturers.</p>

<p>A stone chimney-piece, enriched with tiles executed for the
International Exhibition of 1862, was their first attempt in the
application of enamels and majolica in architectural work. Shortly
afterwards the successful decoration of ceilings was carried out in
the corridors of the India Office. And now the production of majolica
tiles and enamelled terra cotta for all kinds of internal and external
decoration forms an important branch of Messrs. Maw’s manufacture.
Among the more important of their works in enamelled terra cotta may be
mentioned the beautiful staircase executed for Sir D. Majoribanks, a
portion of which was exhibited in the International Exhibition of 1871,
and the chimney-pieces manufactured for the board-room of the South
Kensington Museum, and the Museum of Science and Art, at Edinburgh.
Messrs. Maw were the first in this country to produce the transparent
celeste, or turquoise blue, employed in ancient Chinese enamels,
specimens of which were exhibited in the Paris Exhibition of 1867.</p>

<p>Among their more recent productions may be mentioned tesseræ for mosaic
work, decorated with rich enamels; embossed tiles; “<i>sgrafito</i>,”
a ware the decoration of which is produced by the cutting away of
superimposed layers of different coloured clays, after the fashion of
cameo carving; “<i>slip painting</i>,” the production of a pattern
by the painting of liquid clay on a ground of another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span> colour, and
the whole glazed over, after the first burning, with transparent
coloured enamels; “<i>pâte sur pâte</i>,” tiles in which the design in
high relief is superimposed on a ground of a different colour; mixed
coloured glasses and enamels for the decoration of pottery, by which
the most subtle and brilliant effects are produced; <i>terra cotta and
Parian plant-markers</i>, forming an economical and indestructible
substitute for the old wooden and iron name tallies. On these the names
of trees and shrubs are written in a permanent black enamel and burnt
in.</p>

<p>The special processes employed by Messrs. Maw have been made the
subject of a number of patents, among which may be mentioned their mill
machinery, used in the preparation of clay for the manufacture of tiles
by Prosser’s process; the <i>steam blunger</i>, by which the rough clay
is levigated, sifted, and refined ready for drying on the slip-kilns,
without the intervention of manual labour; the manufacture of encaustic
tiles out of pulverised nearly dry clay, and their patent press worked
by steam power for the pressing of tiles, which is the only successful
application of steam power to screw presses which has yet been attained.</p>

<p>The geometric and tesselated pavements produced by Messrs. Maw are
of the most elegant, elaborate, and beautiful character, and the
tesseræ and tiles of which they are composed are made with the utmost
mechanical accuracy, and of the finest quality both in body, in
colours, and in glaze. The patterns they have prepared are of exquisite
beauty and of endless variety, and suitable for every possible purpose
both for public and private buildings.</p>

<p>The encaustic, or figured tiles, for pavements, are also a great
speciality of Messrs. Maw’s works, and are, like those of other makers,
produced in immense variety and in large quantities. They are made in
two, three, four, or more colours combined, the colours used being
buff or yellow, red, black, blue, chocolate, white, cream, fawn,
green, &amp;c., and of various sizes, the usual dimensions being 6 and 4¼
inches square. The patterns are, in many instances, taken from the
best remaining ancient examples, and in others have been specially
designed for Messrs. Maw by Sir Digby Wyatt, Owen Jones, and the
best authorities of the day; and many of the pavements thus produced
are matchless both in design, in general effect, and in beauty and
brilliancy of colour. Messrs. Maw are not content with producing simple
quarries, to be arranged in the usual varieties of ways, but they have
introduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span> entire pavements, over which is spread one grand design
covering its entire surface; many entire patterns occupying not the
usual old numbers of 4, 9, 12, 16, or 24 tiles, but 144 and other
numbers. These are peculiarly rich and effective, and particularly well
adapted for halls, vestibules, corridors, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The enamelled hearth-pavements and wall-tiles are another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span> great
speciality of these works, and are of unsurpassable richness and
beauty, as are also their majolica tiles and fire-place linings.
These are produced in every possible variety, and are remarkable not
only for the richness and delicacy of the colours which are used,
and for their purely artistic and masterly combination, but for the
excellence of both body and glaze, and the scrupulous accuracy of forms
for fitting together. The same remark applies to the embossed and
indented tiles, and also to those which are partially pierced for open
work. They are all equally good, and bear evidence of that thorough
appreciation of art which pervades all the productions of the Benthall
works. The engravings (Figs. <a href="#image314a">702</a> and <a href="#image315b">703</a>) show two of their majolica
chimney-pieces. The first is of the finest majolica, with a fire-place
lining of encaustic, or enamel, tiles, which would also be used for the
hearth. The decorations are in high and bold relief, and being coloured
with pure artistic taste, have a charming and very striking effect. It
is 4 feet 8 inches in height, and 7 feet in width, and is, of course,
furnished with a marble shelf at the top—which, however, is not shown
in the illustration.</p>

<p>The next shows another of these chimney-pieces entirely complete;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span> it
is, like the other, of majolica. The ornaments are in bold relief, set
off with an excellent arrangement of groundwork and colour; the hearth
is formed of encaustic, or enamelled, or mosaic tiles; and the fender
is of majolica.</p>

<p>Another branch of ceramics—that of “Art Pottery”—has recently been
added to Messrs. Maw’s manufactory. This is the production of vases,
&amp;c., in majolica, a branch which they are eminently qualified to bring
to perfection. In this branch vases, tazzas, and other articles, more
or less decorated with raised or surface ornamentation, are produced.
They are of excellent design, the body light but compact, and the
decorations of remarkably good and artistic character.</p>

<p>One of the names most intimately connected with the early history
of the porcelain manufactures of this kingdom is that of William
Cookworthy, to whom that art is indebted for the discovery of the two
most important of its ingredients, the native kaolin and the petuntse,
and to whose successful experiments and labours its excellence was and
is in a great measure to be attributed. At the time when he first made
his experiments—although Dwight had patented his invention for making
transparent porcelain, although Van Hamme and others had also secured
their rights for similar purposes, although Chelsea and other places
made their china (it is said) of Chinese materials, and although many
experiments had been made on the nature and properties of the earths
supposed to be employed for its manufacture—the art of china-making
from <i>native</i> materials was unknown; and Cookworthy pursued his
course of study unaided by the experience of others, and, though beset
with difficulties at every turn, brought it to a perfectly successful
and satisfactory issue. The history of these experiments, and the life
of this man, are the <i>history</i> of the Plymouth works. The one
is inseparable from the other. The history of the works is the story
of the life of Cookworthy, and the story of that life is the origin,
the success, and the close of those works. The narrative of William
Cookworthy, then, must be the thread of my present history.</p>

<p>William Cookworthy was born at Kingsbridge, not many miles from
Plymouth, on the 12th of April, 1705, his parents being William and
Edith Cookworthy, who were Quakers. His father was a weaver, and
died, leaving his family but ill provided for, in 1718. Thus young
Cookworthy, at the age of thirteen, and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span> six younger brothers
and sisters—for he was the eldest of the family of seven—was left
fatherless. His mother entered upon her heavy task of providing for
and maintaining her large family with true courage, and appears to
have succeeded in working out a good position for them all. She betook
herself to dressmaking, and as her little daughters grew old enough to
handle the needle, they were taught to aid her, and thus she maintained
them in comparative comfort. In the following spring, at the age of
fourteen, young Cookworthy was apprenticed to a chemist in London,
named Bevans; but his mother’s means being too scanty to admit of his
being sent to the metropolis in any other way, he was compelled to
walk there on foot. This task, no light one in those days, a hundred
and fifty years ago, or now, for a boy of fourteen, he successfully
accomplished.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image319">

    class="p1"   
    src="images/image319.jpg"
     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center sm">Fig. 705.—Portrait and Autograph of William Cookworthy.</p>
  </div>

<p>His apprenticeship he appears to have passed with extreme credit, and
on its termination returned into Devonshire, not only with the good
opinion, but with the co-operation of his late master, and commenced
business in Nutt Street, Plymouth, as wholesale chemist and druggist,
under the name of Bevans and Cookworthy. Here he gradually worked his
way forward, and became one of the little knot of intelligent men
who in those days met regularly together at each other’s houses, of
whom Cookworthy, Dr. Huxham, Dr. Mudge, and the elder Northcote, were
among the most celebrated. Here he brought his mother to live under
his roof, and she became by her excellent and charitable character a
general favourite among the leading people of the place, and was looked
up to with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span> great respect by the lower classes whom she benefited. In
1735 Cookworthy married a young Quaker lady of Somersetshire, named
Berry. This lady, to whom he seems to have been most deeply attached,
lived only ten years after their marriage, and left him with five
little daughters; and Cookworthy remained a widower for the remaining
thirty-five years of his life.</p>

<p>In 1745 his attention seems first to have been seriously directed to
experimenting in the manufacture of porcelain—at all events, in this
year the first allusion to the matter which is made in his letters and
papers occurs, and this only casually. In the following letter, written
to his friend and customer, “Richard Hingston, Surgeon, in Penryn,” and
dated May 5th, 1745, this allusion will be found.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="r2">“Plymouth, 30th, 5th mo., 1745.</p>

<p class="p-min">“<span class="smcap">Dear Richard</span>,</p>

<p class="p-min">“My Eastern and South-Ham journeys have kept me of late so much
abroad that I have not had opportunities of writing to thee
equal to my inclination.</p>

<p>“Thy last order went a few days since by Wm. Johns’ barge for
Falmouth, which is the first opportunity that hath offered
since we received it. I am sorry for the damage which happened
to the pill-boxes and party-gold, but am apt to believe it was
taken in the passage, as we always keep the pill-boxes in a
garrett where no moisture can affect them.</p>

<p>“Amos hath, I understand, answered thy question about the beds,
which I believe he was very capable of doing effectually,
having been formerly concerned in filling them at brother
Fox’s. I hope his answer is fully satisfactory.</p>

<p>“We have of late been very barren in news. But, a few days
since, we had certain advice that Admiral Martin’s squadron had
taken a very rich ship from the Havannah, though the captain
from whom Chas. de Voigne hath received a letter says she came
from St. Domingo. ’Tis allowed, however, that she hath a good
deal of money on board, and so ’tis likely she may have been at
both places.</p>

<p>“Chas. de Voigne tells me that Cape Breton is of such
consequence to the French that they cannot do without it, and
we may depend on their exerting their utmost endeavour to
retake it; and if they should be unsuccessful, would never make
peace without its reddition. We had lately a very considerable
sale here for the cargoes of the prizes taken by Martin’s
squadron some time since, and that of the <i>Elephant</i>.
J. Colsworthy was at it, and bought a very large quantity of
sugars on commission, as well as another Friend from London,
whose name is Jonathan Gurnell. We must not be at all surprised
at this, it being by what I can find grown a settled maxim
that Friends may deal in prize goods. For on my attacking F.
Jewel for being concerned in the purchase of the <i>Mentor</i>,
which he bought in partnership with Dr. Dicker and Lancelot
Robinson, he pleaded in his justification that Friends at
London were clearly of opinion there is no harm in it; and
that Jno. Hayward, a preacher, had given him a commission
to buy prize Havannah snuffs. And brother Fox, who has done
something in this way too for the good of his family, acquaints
me that Friend Wilson, when here, seemed to be quite ignorant
of anything wrong in the practice, and only advised in general
that Friends should not act against their convictions. I am not
at present disposed to make reflections, and therefore shall
only say that I hope I shall be kept clear of it, as I believe
it would bring a cloud over my mind.</p>

<p>“I had lately with me the person who hath discovered the
china-earth. He had several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span> samples of the chinaware of their
making with him, which were, I think, equal to the Asiatic.
’Twas found in the back of Virginia, where he was in quest of
mines; and having read Du Halde, discovered both the petunse
and kaulin. ’Tis the latter earth, he says, is the essential
thing towards the success of the manufacture. He is gone for
a cargo of it, having bought the whole country of the Indians
where it rises. They can import it for £13 per ton, and by that
means afford their china as cheap as common stone ware. But
they intend only to go about 30 per cent. under the company.

what is sent that is fit for use.”</p>
</div>

<p>The letter is addressed “For Richard Hingston, Surgeon, in Penryn,” and
is followed by an invoice of goods sent by “Bevans and Cookworthy.”</p>

<p>At this time the business was still carried on under the style of
“Bevans and Cookworthy.” The death of his wife, which took place
within a few months of the writing of this letter, entirely took away
his attention from business, and his researches into china clays were
thrown aside. He retired into seclusion at Looe, in Cornwall, where he
remained for several months, and, on his return to business, took his
brother Philip, who, it appears, had lately returned from abroad, into
partnership, and carried it on, with him under the style of “William
Cookworthy &amp; Co.” This arrangement enabled Cookworthy to devote his
time to the scientific part of the business, and to the prosecution of
his researches, while his brother took the commercial management of the
concern. Left thus more to the bent of his scientific inclinations,
he pursued his inquiries relative to the manufacture of porcelain,
and lost no opportunity of searching into and experimenting upon the
properties of the different natural productions of Cornwall; and it
is related of him that, in his journeys into that county, he has
passed many nights sitting up with the managers of mines, obtaining
information on matters connected with mines and their products. In the
course of these visits he first became acquainted with the supposed
wonderful properties of the “Divining Rod,” or “Dowsing Rod,” as it
was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span> called by the Cornish miners, in the discovery of ore of various
kinds.</p>

<p>In the magic properties of this rod he was an ardent believer, and
he wrote an elaborate dissertation upon its uses, which has been
published. It is entitled “Observations on the Properties of the
Virgula Divina,” and contains, from beginning to end, such a series
of statements as would do well to go side by side with the tales of
spririt-rapping in our day, and which make one wonder at the amount
of credulity that a clever man may occasionally exhibit. So ardent a
believer was he in the value of this rod, that he did not hesitate to
uphold it in the presence of men of high scientific attainments, and
to carry on experiments occasionally to prove to them its correctness.
As might be expected, on most occasions these experiments failed,
but the operator had always some good reason ready to be assigned
for the mishap. On one occasion, after having warmly descanted on
its properties to Dr. Mudge and Dr. Johnson, he agreed to try in his
own garden the experiment as to whether any metal was to be found
beneath its surface, affirming that if metal, whether large or small
in quantity, and at whatever depth, existed, the rod would immediately
indicate its whereabouts. The doctors having previously taken the
precaution to have one of Cookworthy’s large iron mortars, used in his
laboratory, buried in one corner of the garden, unknown to him, the
examination with the rod was gravely made, and resulted in Cookworthy
triumphantly affirming that no metal existed on the spot. The learned
doctors then, in his presence, dug out the mortar to prove that he
was wrong, and had signally failed in his trial. Cookworthy, nothing
disconcerted, however, immediately exclaimed, “Ah, that’s an amalgam!
my rod has no sympathy with amalgams,” and thus spoiled their joke, and
kept his own position at the same time.</p>

<p>His journeys into Cornwall, however, were productive of much more
important results than the fabulous properties of the divining rod,
for it was in these journeys that he succeeded in discovering, after
much anxious inquiry and research, the materials for the manufacture of
genuine porcelain. The information given him by the “Quaker” in 1745
had never been lost sight of, and he prosecuted inquiries wherever he
went. After many searchings and experiments, he at length discovered
the two materials, first in Tregonnin Hill, in Germo parish; next in
the parish of St. Stephen’s; and again at Boconnoc, the family seat of
Thomas Pitt, Lord Camelford.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span> There is a kind of traditionary belief
that he first found the stone he was anxious to discover in the tower
of St. Columb Church, which is built of stone from St. Stephen’s,
and which thus led him to the spot where it was to be procured. At
this time he lodged at Carlogges, in St. Stephen’s parish, with a Mr.
Yelland, and was in the habit of going about the neighbourhood with his
“dowsing rod,” in search of mineral treasures. This discovery would
probably be about 1754 or 1755.</p>

<p>Having made this important discovery, Cookworthy appears to have
determined at once to carry out his intention of making porcelain, and
to secure the material to himself. To this end he went to London to
see the proprietors of the land, and to arrange for the royalty of the
materials. In this he succeeded; and ultimately Lord Camelford joined
him in the manufacture of china, and, as appears from a letter of that
nobleman to Polwhele, the historian of Cornwall, the two expended about
three thousand pounds in prosecuting the work. The letter of Lord
Camelford, which is dated “Boconnoc, Nov. 30, 1790,” is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“With regard to the Porcelain Manufactory that was attempted
to be established some years ago, and which was afterwards
transferred to Bristol, where it failed, it was undertaken by
Mr. Cookworthy, upon a friend of his having discovered on an
estate of mine, in the parish of St. Stephen’s, a certain white
saponaceous clay, and close by it a species of granite, or
moor-stone, white, with greenish spots, which he immediately
perceived to be the two materials described by the missionary
Père D’Entrecolles, as the constituent parts of Chinese
porcelain, the one giving whiteness and body to the paste, the
other vitrification and transparency. The difficulties found in
proportioning properly these materials, so as to give exactly
the necessary degree of vitrification and no more, and other
niceties with regard to the manipulation, discouraged us from
proceeding in this concern, after we had procured a patent
for the use of our materials, and expended on it between two
and three thousand pounds. We then sold our interest to Mr.
Champion, of Bristol.”</p>
</div>

<p>It will be seen that Lord Camelford in this letter says that the
discovery was made by a <i>friend</i> of Cookworthy’s. Whether this
were so or not is matter of little consequence, but it is due to
Cookworthy, who was strictly conscientious and scrupulously honest and
straightforward in all his transactions, to say that he has left it
on record that he himself made the discovery, as will be seen by the
following highly interesting paper written by him, but unfortunately
without date:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is now near twenty years since I discovered that the
ingredients used by the Chinese in the composition of their
porcelain, were to be got, in immense quantities, in the county
of Cornwall; and as I have since that time, by abundance of
experiments, clearly proved this to the entire satisfaction
of many ingenious men, I was willing this discovery might be
preserved to posterity, if I should not live to carry it into a
manufacture; and, with this view, I have thought proper to put
in writing, in a summary way, all I have discovered about this
matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span></p>

<p>“The account of the materials used by the Chinese is very
justly given by the Jesuit missionaries, as well as their
manner of preparing and mixing them into the China-ware
paste. They observe, the Chinese have two sorts of bodies for
porcelain; one prepared with Petunse and Caulin, the other with
Petunse and Wha She or Soapy Rock. The Petunse they describe
to be prepared from a quarry stone of a particular kind, by
beating it in stamping-mills, and washing off and settling the
parts which are beaten fine. This ingredient gives the ware
transparency and mellowness, and is used for glazing it. The
stone of this Petunse is a species of the granite, or, as we in
the west call it, the moor-stone.</p>

<p>“I first discovered it in the parish of Germo, in a hill called
Tregonnin Hill; the whole country in depth is of this stone.
It reaches, east and west, from Breag to Germo, and north and
south, from Tregonnin Hill to the sea. From the cliffs some
of this stone hath been brought to Plymouth, where it was
used in the casemates of the garrison; but I think the best
quarries are in Tregonnin Hill. The stone is compounded of
small pellucid gravel, and a whitish matter, which, indeed,
is Caulin petrified; and as the Caulin of Tregonnin Hill hath
abundance of mica in it, this stone hath them also. If the
stone is taken a fathom or two from the surface, where the
rock is quite solid, it is stained with abundance of greenish
spots, which are very apparent when it is wetted. This is a
circumstance noted by the Jesuits, who observe that the stones
which have the most of this quality are the most proper for
the preparation of the glaze; and I believe this remark is
just, as I know that they are the most easily vitrifiable,
and that a vein of this kind in Tregonnin Hill is so much
so that it makes an excellent glaze without the addition of
vitrescent ingredients. If a small crucible is filled up with
this stone, or a piece of it put in it, and exposed to the
most violent fire of a good wind furnace for an hour, the
stone will be melted into a beautiful mass; all its impurities
will be discharged, one part of it will be almost of a limpid
transparency, and the other appear in spots as white as snow.
The former is the gravel, the other the Caulin, reduced by fire
to purity. If the fire is not continued long enough to effect
this, the upper part and middle of the mass will be of a dirty
colour, and the bottom and parts of the sides fine.</p>


<p class="center sm p1">“CAULIN.</p>

<p>“This material, in the Chinese way of speaking, constitutes the
bones, as the Petunse does the flesh, of china ware. It is a
white talcy earth, found in our granite countries, both in the
counties of Devon and Cornwall. It lies in different depths
beneath the surface. Sometimes there shall be a fathom or more
of earth above it, and at other times two or three feet. It
is found on the sides of hills, and in valleys; in the sides,
where, following the course of the hills, the surface sinks, or
is concave, and seldom, I believe, or never where it swells,
or is convex. By what I have observed, it is by no means a
regular stratum, but is rather in bunches or heaps, the regular
continuance of which is frequently interrupted by gravel and
other matters. At times there are veins of it among the solid
rocks, when it is constantly very pure from gravel. I have a
piece by me of this kind, very fine.</p>

<p>“There are inexhaustible stores of this Caulin in the two
western counties. The use it’s commonly put to is in mending
the tin furnaces and the fire-places of the fire-engines,
for which ’tis very proper. The sort I have chiefly tried is
what is got from the side of Tregonnin Hill, where there are
several pits of it. As the stone hath a pretty large quantity
of Caulin in it, so the Caulin hath a large mixture of the same
sort of gravel as enters into the composition of the stone. It
contains, besides, mica in abundance.</p>

<p>“In order to prepare the Caulin for porcelain, nothing more
is necessary but pouring a large quantity of water on it, so
that it may not, when dissolved, be of so thick a consistence
as to suspend the mica. Let it settle about ten minutes, and
pour off the dissolved clay into another vessel. Let it settle,
pour off the water, and dry it. I will observe here, that care
ought to be taken about the water used in washing off both the
Petunse and Caulin. It ought to be pure, without any metallic
or calcareous mixture. Our rivers in the west afford excellent
water for this purpose, as they arise, the most of them, and
run through a granite country. The Caulin of Tregonnin Hill is
very unvitrifiable, and exceedingly apt to take stains from the
fire. I know no way to burn it clean but the following:—Form
it into cakes of the thickness of two or three crown pieces,
and beat some of the stone to a very coarse powder; cover the
bottom of the crucible with this powder; then put in a cake of
the Caulin; cover this the thickness of one-third of an inch
with the powder of stone; fill the crucible in this way, ending
with a layer of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span> the stone; cover the crucible, and treat it
as in the process for melting the stone before described. If
the stone is burned to purity, the Caulin will be as white as
snow; if but partially calcined, so far as the stone is pure,
the Caulin will be so; and when that is of a dirty colour, the
Caulin will be of the same hue.</p>

<p>“I have lately discovered that, in the neighbourhood of the
parish of St. Stephen’s, in Cornwall, there are immense
quantities both of the Petunse stone and the Caulin, and which,
I believe, may be more commodiously and advantageously wrought
than those of Tregonnin Hill, as, by the experiments I have
made on them, they produce a much whiter body, and do not
shrink so much, by far, in baking, nor take stains so readily
from the fire. Tregonnin Hill is about a mile from Godolphin
House, between Helston and Penzance. St. Stephen’s lies between
Truro, St. Austel, and St. Columb; and the parish of Dennis,
the next to St. Stephen’s, I believe, hath both the ingredients
in plenty in it. I know of two quarries of the stone—one
is just above St. Stephen’s, the other is called Caluggus,
somewhat more than a mile from it, and appears to be the finer
stone.</p>

<p>“Having given this sketch of the natural history of the
materials, ’tis needless to say much about the composition.
Pottery being at present in great perfection in England, our
potters’-mills prepare the Petunse much better than stamping
mills, and excuse one from the trouble of washing it off, it
being fit to be used as it comes from the mill. I would further
observe that the mills should be made of the Petunse granite,
it being obvious that, in grinding, some of the mill-stones
must wear off and mix with the Petunse. If those stones should
be of a nature disagreeable to the body, this mixture must,
in some degree, be hurtful to it; whereas, whatever wears off
from mill-stones of the same stone, cannot be so in the least
degree. I have generally mixed about equal parts of the washed
Caulin and Petunse for the composition of the body, which, when
burnt, is very white, and sufficiently transparent. The Caulin
of St. Stephen’s burns to a degree of transparency without the
addition of Petunse. The materials from this place make a body
much whiter than the Asiatic, and, I think, full as white as
the ancient chinaware, or that of Dresden.</p>

<p>“The stones I have hitherto used for glazing are those with
the green spots of Tregonnin Hill. These, barely ground fine,
make a good glaze. If ’tis wanted softer, vitrescent materials
must be added. The best I have tried are those said to be
used by the Chinese, viz., lime and fern-ashes, prepared as
follows:—The lime is to be slacked by water, and sifted.
One part of this, by measure, is to be mixed with twice its
quantity of fern-ashes, and calcined together in an iron pot,
the fire to be raised till the matter is red hot. It should not
melt, and for that reason should be kept continually stirred.
When it sinks in the pot, and grows of a light ash colour, ’tis
done. It then must be levigated in the potter’s mill to perfect
smoothness. It may be used in proportion of one part to ten,
and so on to fifteen or twenty of the stone, as shall be found
necessary. We found one to fifteen of the stone a very suitable
proportion. Our manner of mixing was to dilute both the stones
and the ashes to a proper degree for dipping, and then to mix
them as above. On mixing, the whole grows thicker. If ’tis too
thick for dipping, more water must be added. Our method of
dipping was just the same as is used by the delft-ware people.
We first baked our ware to a soft biscuit, which would suck,
then painted it with blue, and dipped them with the same ease;
and the glazing grows hard and dry, as soon as it does in the
delft-ware. Large vessels may be dipped raw, as the Chinese are
said to do it. But the proper thickness of the glaze is not so
easily distinguished this way, as when the ware is biscuited;
for, the raw body being of the same colour and consistence with
the glaze, when the latter is dry, ’tis hardly possible to
determine the limits of either; a thing very easy to be done
when the body is hardened by biscuiting. Our chinaware makers
in general deny it to be possible to glaze on a raw body or
soft biscuit. And so it is with their glaze; which, abounding
in lead and other fluxing materials, melts soon and runs thin,
and, melting before the body closes, penetrates it, and is lost
in the body, whereas our stone is almost as hard to melt as
the body is to close; and, not melting thin, neither runs nor
penetrates the body. I insist on the truth of this observation,
and ’tis necessary to be insisted on, as scarcely any of our
potters, misled by too slavish dependence on their own too
partial experience, will allow it. I have said above that the
Jesuits observe that the Chinese paint and glaze their ware on
the raw body. I know this can be done, for I have done it; and
so may anyone else who pleases to try it. I have now by me the
bottom of a Chinese punch-bowl, which was plainly glazed, when
it was raw, or a soft biscuit; for the ware wants a great deal
of being burnt, it being of the colour of coarse whited-brown
paper. But the same body, when exposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span> to a proper degree
of fire, turns to a chinaware of a very good colour—a
demonstration that it had not, as our ware in England hath, the
great fire before the glaze was laid on. I don’t point out the
advantages of painting and glazing on a soft biscuit, as they
are very obvious to anyone, ever so little used to pottery.</p>

<p>“In regard to burning, I have to remark, that by all the
experiments we have made, the north of England kilns, where the
fire is applied in mouths on the outside of the kilns, and the
fuel is coal, will not do for our body, at least when it is
composed of the materials of Tregonnin Hill.</p>

<p>“In those kilns especially, when bags are used, there is no
passage of air through the middle of the kiln; and a vapour, in
spite of all the care that can be taken, will either transpire
through the bags, or be reflected from the crown, which will
smoke and spoil our ware, though it doth not appear to affect
other compositions. How true this remark may be, with regard to
the St. Stephen’s materials I cannot determine, as they have
not yet been tried in a kiln. The only furnace or kiln which
we have tried with any degree of success, is the kiln used by
the potters who make brown stone. It is called the 36-hole
kiln. Wood is the fuel used in it. They burn billets before and
under it, where there is an oven or arch pierced by 36-holes,
through which the flame ascends into the chamber which contains
the ware, and goes out at as many holes of the same dimensions
in the crown of the furnace. The safeguards at bottom stand
on knobs of clay, which won’t melt, about two inches square,
and two inches and a half or three inches high; by which means
more of the holes are stopped by the bottoms of the safeguard,
but the air and flame freely ascend, and play round every
safeguard; by which means those tingeing vapours, which have
given us so much trouble, are kept in continual motion upward,
and hindered from penetrating and staining the ware.</p>

<p>“Experience must determine the best form and way of using this
kiln. ’Tis the only desideratum wanting to the bringing of
the manufacture of porcelain, equal to any in the world, to
perfection in England.</p>

<p>“Caulin pipeclay and a coarse unvitrifiable sand make excellent
safeguards.”</p>
</div>

<p>The experiments on the Cornish materials having been perfectly
successful, Cookworthy established himself as a china manufacturer
at Plymouth. The works were at Coxside, at the extreme angle which
juts into the water at Sutton Pool. Some parts of the buildings still
exist, and are used as a shipwright’s yard. They are still known by
the name of the “China House,” and it is really pleasant to find that
a memory of these once celebrated works is yet retained on the spot
where they were carried on. It is strange, however, to think that the
same building which was used for the fabricating of the finest and most
delicate and fragile articles, should now be used for the constructing
of huge seaworthy vessels, which can withstand the force of the waves,
and bear heavy burthens in safety across the seas, whether in calm or
storm.</p>

<p>In these works Cookworthy prosecuted his new art with great success,
and was soon enabled to enter the market with Englishmade hard-paste
china, composed of native materials alone. The early examples are,
as is natural to expect, very coarse, rough, and inferior, but they
evidence, nevertheless, considerable skill in mixing, though not so
much, perhaps, in firing. And they are also remarkable for their
clumsiness, as well as for their bad colour, their uneven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span> glazing, and
their being almost invariably disfigured by fire cracks—if nowhere
else, almost invariably at the bottom. On many of the pieces the colour
(blue) on which the pattern was drawn, has “run” in the glazing, and
thus disfigured the pieces. As examples of the early make of Plymouth,
an inkstand belonging to Mrs. Lydia Prideaux, of Plymouth, is an
excellent specimen. It was for many years the office inkstand of her
father, who died in 1796, and was got by him from the son of a workman
in the china factory. It is very clumsy in make, of coarse body, rough
in the glaze, uneven in colour, and is, perhaps, one of the best and
most characteristic existing specimens of the <i>early</i> make of
Plymouth. It is circular, nearly five and a half inches in diameter;
around the top is a border in blue, and round the hollowed sides
are octagonal spaces with Chinese figures and landscapes, connected
together by a diapered band, all in blue. The inkstand bears the usual
Plymouth mark on the bottom, in blue.</p>

<p>Another early example worthy of note is a pounce-pot, formerly in the
possession of the late Mr. James, of Bristol. Like the inkstand and
other early examples, it is coarse in texture, rough on the surface,
and imperfect in the glaze. It is painted with flowers in blue, and has
the mark also in blue on the bottom.</p>

<p>As on the earliest productions of all the old china works, the
decorations on the Plymouth examples are invariably blue; the blue at
first being of a heavy, dull, blackish shade, but gradually improving,
until, on some specimens which I have seen, it had attained a clear
brilliance. Cookworthy, being a good chemist, paid considerable
attention to the producing of a good blue, and was the first who
succeeded in this country in manufacturing cobalt blue direct from
the ore. Before this time the colour was prepared by grinding
foreign imported zaffres with slab and muller; but after a series
of experiments he succeeded in producing a fine and excellent blue
from the cobalt ore, and prepared it by a better process. It is said
that Cookworthy himself painted some of the earlier blue and white
productions of his manufactory, and this is not at all improbable.</p>

<p>Examples of the finer and more advanced class of blue and white are,
like the earlier and more primitive attempts, scarce.</p>

<p>The white porcelain of Plymouth is one of its notable features, for in
it some remarkably fine works exist in different collections. These
mostly consist of salt-cellars, pickle-cups, and toilet-pieces,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span> formed
of shells and corals, beautifully, indeed exquisitely, modelled from
nature. The shells and corals, and other marine objects which compose
these pieces, are remarkably true to nature, and their arrangement
in groups is very artistic and good. As a rule these pieces are not
marked. Some of the forms of these shell groups are shown in the
accompanying engravings. The accidental arrangement of the small
shells, sea-weeds, and coral, are very characteristic of Plymouth
manufacture, and evince a high degree of artistic excellence. The
salt-cellars of this description, in the Museum of Practical Geology,
are good examples, and useful for reference. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span> white, too, Cookworthy
produced figures, birds, and animals, both singly and in groups, which
bore no mark. Amongst the most successful and important productions of
the Plymouth works, in white, are busts, of which one or two excellent
examples are in existence. The finest of these is a bust, of large
size, of King George II., in possession of the late Dr. Cookworthy,
of Plymouth, the great-nephew of William Cookworthy, the founder of
the works, from whom it has passed in succession to its present owner,
who is now the sole representative of the family. The bust, which is
remarkably fine, and exquisitely modelled, evidences a very advanced
state of Art, and shows great skill, both in modelling, in body, and in
firing. Its height is seventeen inches, and its extreme width thirteen
inches. Dr. Cookworthy also possessed some remarkably fine allegorical
figures, groups for candlesticks, &amp;c., all, although unmarked, said
to be authenticated as Plymouth manufacture. An elephant said to be
probably of Plymouth manufacture is in the Museum of Practical Geology,
as are also Figs. <a href="#image328c">708</a> and <a href="#image332b">713</a>.</p>

<p>The prosecution of the new works having progressed satisfactorily,
Cookworthy in 1768 took out a patent for the manufacture of “a kind
of porcelain newly invented by me, composed of moor-stone or growan,
and growan clay.” The patent was dated the 17th of March, 1768, and
contained the usual proviso that full specification should be lodged
and enrolled within four months of that date. This specification was
duly enrolled, and I am happy to be able to give it <i>in extenso</i>
to my readers. It is a most interesting document, and contains a great
deal of valuable information; it is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To all people to whom these presents shall come, I, William
Cookworthy, of Plymouth, in the County of Devon, Chemist, send
greeting.</p>

<p>“Whereas His Most Gracious Majesty King George the Third, by
Letters Patent bearing date at Westminster the Seventeenth
day of March now last past, did give and grant unto me, the
said William Cookworthy, my executors, administrators, and
assigns, his especial license, full power, sole privilege and
authority, that I, the said William Cookworthy, my executors,
administrators, and assigns, and every of us, by myself and
themselves, and by mine and their deputy or deputys, servants
or agents, or such others as I, the said William Cookworthy,
my executors, administrators, or assigns, should at any time
agree with, and no others, from time to time, and at all times
thereafter during the term of years therein expressed, should
and lawfully might make, use, exercise, and vend ‘<span class="smcap">a kind
of Porcellain newly invented by me, compos’d of Moor-stone
or Growan, and Growan Clay</span>,’ within that part of His
Majesty’s kingdom of Great Britain called England, his dominion
of Wales, and town of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span> Berwick-upon-Tweed, in such manner as to
me, the said William Cookworthy, my executors, administrators,
and assigns, or any of us, should in our discretion seem
meet, and that I, the said William Cookworthy, my executors,
administrators, and assigns, should and lawfully might have and
enjoy the whole profit, benefit, commodity, and advantage from
time to time coming, growing, accruing, and arising by reason
of the said invention, for and during the term of years therein
mentioned, to have, hold, exercise, and enjoy the said license,
powers, privileges, and advantages thereinbefore granted unto
me, the said William Cookworthy, my executors, administrators,
and assigns, for and during and unto the full end and term of
fourteen years from the date of the said Letters Patent, next
and immediately ensuing, and fully to be compleat and ended
according to the statute in such case made and provided; in
which said Letters Patent there is contained a provisoe as or
to the effect following (viz.), that if I, the said William
Cookworthy, should not particularly describe and ascertain the
nature of my said invention, and in what manner the same was
to be performed, by an instrument in writing under my hand
and seal, and cause the same to be inrolled in His Majesty’s
High Court of Chancery within four calendar months next and
immediately after the date of the said Letters Patent; that
then the said Letters Patent and all libertys and advantages
whatsoever thereby granted should utterly cease, determine, and
become void, as in and by the said Letters Patent (relation
being thereunto had) more fully and at large it doth and may
appear.</p>

<p>“Now know ye that I, the said William Cookworthy, in pursuance
of the said recited provisoe, do, by this my Deed in writing,
declare and make known the nature of my said invention, and
the quality of the materials, and manner in which the same is
performed, which is as followeth (that is to say):—</p>

<p>“The materials of which the body of the said porcellain
is composed are a stone and earth, or clay. The stone is
known in the countys of Devon and Cornwall by the names of
Moor-stone and Growan, which stones are generally composed of
grains of stone or gravel of a white or whitish colour, with
a mixture of talky shining particles. This gravel and these
talky particles are cemented together by a petrified clay
into very solid rocks, and immense quantities of them are
found in both the above-mentioned countys. All these stones,
exposed to a violent fire, melt without the addition of fluxes
into a semi-transparent glass, differing in clearness and
beauty according to the purity of the stone. The earth, or
clay, for the most part lies in the valleys where the stone
forms the hills. This earth is very frequently very white,
tho’ sometimes of a yellowish or cream colour. It generally
arises with a large mixture of talky micæ, or spangles, and a
semi-transparent or whitish gravel. Some sorts have little of
the micæ, or spangles, but the best clay for making porcellain
always abounds in micæ, or spangles. The stone is prepared by
levigation in a potter’s mill, in water in the usual manner, to
a very fine powder. The clay is prepared by diluting it with
water untill the mixture is rendered sufficiently thin for the
gravell and micæ to subside; the white water containing the
clay is then poured, or left to run off from the subsided micæ
and gravell into proper vessells or reservoirs; and after it
has settled a day or two, the clear water above it is to be
then poured or drawn off, and the clay, or earth, reduced to a
proper consistence by the common methods of exposing it to the
sun and air, or laying it on chalk. This earth, or clay, gives
the ware its whiteness and infusibility, as the stone doth its
transparency and mellowness: they are therefore to be mix’d in
different proportions, as the ware is intended to be more or
less transparent; and the mixture is to be performed in the
method used by potters, and well known (viz., by diluting the
materials in water, passing the mixture through a fine sieve,
and reducing it to a paste of a proper consistence for working
in the way directed for the preparation of the clay). This
paste is to be form’d into vessells, and these vessells, when
biscuited, are to be dipp’d in the glaze, which is prepared of
the levigated stone, with the addition of lime and fern-ashes,
or an earth called magnesia alba, in such quantity as may make
it properly fusible and transparent when it has received a due
degree of fire in the second baking.</p>

<p>“In witness whereof I, the said William Cookworthy, have
hereunto sett my hand and seal this Eleventh day of July, in
the Eighth year of the reign of our Sovereign Lord George
the Third, by the grace of God of Great Britain, France, and
Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, and so forth, and in the
year of our Lord One Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-eight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span></p>

<p>“And be it remembered that on aforesaid Eleventh day of
July, in the year above-mentioned, the aforesaid William
Cookworthy came before our said Lord the King in his Chancery,
and acknowledged the Specification aforesaid, and all and
everything therein contained and specified in form above
written. And also the Specification aforesaid was stampt
according to the tenor of the statute made in the sixth year
of the reign of the late King and Queen William and Mary of
England, and so forth.</p>

<p class="p-min">“Inrolled the Fourteenth day of July, in the year above written.</p>

<p class="r2 p-min">“<span class="smcap">Samuel Champion</span>, a Master Extraordinary.”</p>
</div>

<p>It is natural to suppose that the finest and best goods of the
Plymouth Works were produced in the six years which intervened between
the enrolling of this specification and the removal of the Works to
Bristol, previous to their sale to Champion. The progress of the
manufactory had hitherto been great and satisfactory, but continuing
at the same rate of improvement, the perfection to which the best
productions arrived could only have been attained a very short time
before its close.</p>

<p>Cookworthy determined to make his porcelain equal to that of Sèvres and
Dresden, both in body, which he himself mixed, and in ornamentation,
for which he procured the services of such artists as were available.
To this end he engaged a Mon. Saqui, or Soqui, from Sèvres, who was
a man of rare talent as a painter and enameller, and to whose hands,
and those of Henry Bone, a native of Plymouth, who there is reason
to suppose was apprenticed to Cookworthy, and afterwards became very
celebrated, the best painted specimens may be ascribed. Besides these
several other artists were employed, but they were principally engaged
in painting in blue, while Saqui and Bone painted the high-class birds
and flowers.</p>

<p>In a town like Plymouth, where Art has always found a home, and
whose sons have so greatly distinguished themselves, it is not to be
wondered that the paintings and decorations on china should assume
a high character for design and treatment. In a neighbourhood which
has the honour of having given birth to Sir Joshua Reynolds, to James
Northcote, to Haydon, to Sir Charles Eastlake, to Opie, to William
Cooke, and to a score others, it would be strange indeed if the Art
part of the manufacture had not been prominently good, and had not
produced artists, like Henry Bone, of more than local excellence.</p>

<p>The ware made at Plymouth consisted of dinner services, tea and coffee
services, mugs and jugs; vases, trinket and toilet stands, busts,
single figures and groups, animals, “Madonnas,” and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span> figures
after foreign models, candlesticks with birds, flowers, &amp;c., &amp;c. The
large mug (Fig. <a href="#image332b">712</a>) is an excellent example of the higher, and,
of course, later, productions of Cookworthy’s manufactory. It is a
quart mug, remarkably well potted, clear in its colour and glaze, and
exquisitely painted by Saqui on the one side with peacock and pheasant
and landscapes, and on the other with a group of flowers. Mugs of this
form, and different sizes, painted with birds and flowers, are to be
found in different collections, and are usually marked in red or blue.
The peculiarity of the specimen here engraved is, that besides being
remarkably good in its painting, it is marked with the usual sign,
but instead of being in colour, is incised before glazing. The bottom
is also disfigured, as so frequently occurs, with a fire crack. The
incised mark on this mug is engraved (Fig. <a href="#image332a">710</a>). Some very good mugs of
the form and style of this one were shown in the Exhibition of 1851, in
Mr. Phillips’s case, illustrating the raw material and productions of
the clay district. They were marked in red, and belonged to Mr. George
Pridham, of Plymouth. On the same engraving with the mug I have given a
representation of a teapot, which is beautifully painted with groups of
flowers in pink. That Cookworthy endeavoured to procure good artists is
evident by the following advertisement in 1770:—</p>

<p>“China painters wanted, for the Plymouth new invented Patent
Porcelain Manufactory.—A number of sober, ingenious artists,
capable of painting in enamel or blue, may hear of constant
employ by sending their proposals to Thomas Frank, in Castle
Street, Bristol.”</p>
</div>

<p>Among the busts and statuettes are an admirable bust of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span> George II.,
after the statue by Ruysbranch, in Queen’s Square, Bristol; Woodward,
the actor; Mrs. Clive; a shepherd; and shepherdess, &amp;c., which show
that excellent modellers must have been employed.</p>

<p>One of the finest productions of the Plymouth Works, and evidently of
the latest, is a pair of splendid vases and covers, sixteen inches
high, in the possession of Mr. Francis Fry, of Bristol. One of these
is here engraved (Fig. <a href="#image333">714</a>). It is hexagonal, and is enriched with
festoons of beautifully-modelled raised flowers, and with painted
butterflies, leaves, borders, &amp;c. These vases are of precisely the same
general form as some unique examples of Bristol make, which I shall
have to describe when writing on those works, from which, however, they
differ in ornament and detail, and they are evidently the production of
the same artists. They are marked with the usual sign in red.</p>

  </div>

<p>In Lord Mount Edgcumbe’s possession, too, is a pair of vases of very
similar character (but more nearly resembling Mr. Fry’s specimens of
Bristol), on which the Plymouth mark has, at a later period, been
added. Many good examples of Plymouth still remain in the hands of
families resident in Plymouth and its neighbourhood, and in the
cabinets of most collectors.</p>

<p>In the Museum of Practical Geology some characteristic examples of
Plymouth ware may be seen. Among these are a pair of shell-salts (Fig.
<a href="#image328c">708</a>); a pair of figures, “Europe” and “Asia,” and some other figures;
some remarkably good mugs, jugs, and sauce boats; one or two cups and
saucers; and other pieces. There are also two plates (one of which is
shown on Fig. <a href="#image334a">715</a>), described as “in earthenware, with thick white
enamel, painted,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span> the one with flowers, and the other “in green, with
flowers on the border and crest of the Parker family in the centre.
Unmarked.”</p>

     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center sm">Fig. 715.</p>
  </div>

<p>The mark of the Plymouth china is usually painted in red or blue on the
bottom of the pieces. No mark has yet, however, come under my notice
on the white examples. On the early blue and white the mark appears
invariably to be in blue, and somewhat thick and clumsy in its drawing.
On the later and more advanced goods it is more neatly drawn in red or
blue. It varies a little in form, according to the different “hand” by
which it was affixed. The mark is the chemical sign for tin or mercury,
ꝝ, and was doubtless chosen by Cookworthy, the chemist, to
denote that the materials from which it was made, and which he had
discovered, were procured from the stanniferous district of Cornwall.
The following are varieties of the mark selected from different
specimens:—</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image334b">

     <p class="p0 center sm">Figs. 716 to 724.</p>
  </div>

<p>On some other examples the sign with the addition of the Bristol mark
of the cross beneath it occurs; and on others a number, as if to denote
the number of the pattern (or possibly of the workman), occurs. These
two marks, the simple sign and the sign with the number, occur on
pieces belonging to the same set.</p>

<p class="center smaller">M<sup>r</sup><br>

<p>In Mr. Skardon’s possession is a pair of small sauce boats, embossed
and painted with birds and flowers in colours; they each bear the name,
painted on the bottom, as here shown. In Dr. Ashford’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span> possession is
an example bearing a very similar mark, but in writing letters, thus:—</p>

<p class="center smaller"><i>M<sup>r</sup></i><br>
<i>W. Cookworthy’s</i><br>
<i>Factory Plymouth</i><br>
1770</p>

<p>Another curious example, formerly in the possession of Mr. C. W.
Reynolds, bears the word “Plymouth,” the arms of the borough, some
illegible letters, and the date “March 14 1768 C F.”</p>

<p>However beautiful and satisfactory the productions of the Plymouth
works might be as <i>china</i>, they were not, it would appear,
remunerative <i>commercially</i>. The clay and the stone Cookworthy
had within easy distance, but his material was difficult and expensive
to make, his experiments produced frequent failures and losses, and
therefore he was unable to keep pace with other manufactories, and
to compete with them. Add to this that he was far from being a young
man—being then in his seventieth year—it is not surprising that
he should determine on giving up the works, especially when Lord
Camelford, who was one of his partners, says between two and three
thousand pounds had been sunk in their prosecution.</p>

<p>On the 6th of May, 1774, therefore, William Cookworthy (who, it would
appear probable, had already removed the manufacture to Bristol), for
considerations set forth in the deed of assignment, sold the business
and patent-right to Richard Champion, merchant, of Bristol, who had
been connected pecuniarily with the works at Plymouth, and who had
previously, “under license from the patentee” (William Cookworthy),
commenced the manufacture of china in Bristol, under the style of “W.
Cookworthy &amp; Co.,” and they were transferred to that city.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Champion
appears to have been a connection of Cookworthy’s—a cousin of the
latter, Phillip Debell Tuckett, marrying, in August, 1774, a sister
of the former (Esther Champion), about the time when the affairs for
the transfer of the works were finally completed; and the arrangements
appear to have been completed entirely to Cookworthy’s satisfaction.
The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span> following letter, highly characteristic of Cookworthy’s style,
relates to the settlement of the transfer. Though without date, it
evidently was written only a short time prior to the 6th of May, 1774.
It is addressed to his cousin, Anna Cookworthy, of Plymouth:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="r2">“Bristol, 4th day, 10 o’clock.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Cousin</span>,</p>

<p>“When I wrote my last to thy father, I hoped to have left this
city, last second day; but such hath been the nature of the
affair which detains me here, that though I have endeavoured,
to the utmost of my power, to get it completed, I cannot yet
succeed. The attorney assures me that we shall have everything
ready by next fifth day; and, if he is as good as his word,
we shall finish our matters that evening, or the next day at
farthest. And then, if health permits, I shall set out in
the machine second day morning, and reach Plymouth on fourth
day.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>“I am heartily disposed to show every mark of respect to a
niece so sincerely and justly esteemed by me; and it hath been
one source of anxiety and vexation to me that I have been so
long detained here; but there is really a necessity for my
closing our affair before I leave this city. When this is done,
I shall set my face towards Plymouth with great pleasure. Not
that I have any reason to complain of Bristol; for, though I
have had the load of important and difficult affairs on my
mind, and have gone through a real fit of the gout besides, I
have been helped through all in the enjoyment of calm spirits
and inward satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I have a budget full of interesting matter for your
entertainment at my return. I have not had the least reason to
complain of R. Champion’s behaviour; and all my acquaintance
at Bristol have shown me much kindness and respect; and, on
the whole, my time hath been spent agreeably amongst them,
all things considered. For, considering my attention to
china-wares, the closing of my business with R. Champion,
the settling the lovers’ matters, which were in a much worse
situation than we imagined; all this, and the attending
meetings, have made the last month the busiest one to me that I
have known for many years. But quiet dependence is sufficient
to carry us, safely and well, through all those things in
which Providence engages us. Let this be an encouragement to
my dear niece through every difficulty she may meet with. Let
us but determine in all things to do our duty, depending only
on Him who is mighty to help, and nothing that can befall us
can be hurtful to us. Let us learn to despise the superficial
judgment of a world that looks only at things that are seen;
which renders all its spacious wisdom foolishness in reality.
Let the attainment and possession of a conscience void of
offence, regulate us in all our views and pursuits; and let us
implore the help of the Great Father, and steadily wait for it,
through the whole course of our conduct; and we shall know that
blessing which maketh rich, and addeth no sorrow with it to
rest on our hearts and houses.</p>

<p>“Farewell, my dear cousin; and, farewell, all my dear friends.
I am hastening to meeting.</p>

<p class="r2 p-min">“<span class="smcap">W. Cookworthy.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>The works having been transferred to Bristol, were carried on by
Richard Champion, who having incurred considerable expense without
a proportionate return, petitioned in the same year for a further
term of fourteen years patent-right to be extended to him, which was
accordingly done by Act of Parliament passed in the session which
commenced the 29th of November in the same year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span> (1774). This Act and
others will be found noticed in my account of the Bristol china works.</p>

<p>Thus ended, after the brief period of nineteen or twenty years from
the first discovery of the material to its close, the manufacture
of porcelain in Plymouth—a manufacture which was an honour to the
locality, a credit to all concerned in it, and which has given it, and
Cookworthy its founder, an imperishable name in the ceramic annals of
this country.</p>

<p>Having passed through the history of the works, so far as scantiness
of material will allow, it only remains to turn back for a few minutes
to the thread of the life of Cookworthy with which I started, and to
follow it, so far as may be necessary, to its close.</p>

<p>During the time he was engaged on the manufacture of chinaware,
his ever-active mind seems to have been busied with other things
as well, and he appears to have been sought, and much esteemed, by
the <i>savans</i> of the day. Smeaton, the builder of the Eddystone
Lighthouse, was an inmate of his house while the lighthouse was
in progress, and they were constant companions in examining the
dove-tailed blocks of stone as they were prepared on the Hoe for
shipping; Wolcot—“Peter Pindar”—was a frequent visitor for days
together at his house; Sir Joseph Banks, Captain Cook, and Dr.
Solander, were his guests just before the famous “Voyage Round the
World” and on their return, when their <i>protégé</i>, Omai the
Otaheitan, was also his guest; Earl St. Vincent, then Captain Jervis,
was his attached friend, and he was looked up to by all as a man of
such large understanding, such varied and extensive knowledge, and
such powers of intellectual conversation, that, as Lord St. Vincent is
said often to have remarked, “whoever was in Mr. Cookworthy’s company
was always wiser and better for having been in it.” He carried on
considerable experiments to discover a method by which sea-water might
be distilled for use on board ship. He was a disciple of Swedenborg,
some of whose works he translated, and was also an accomplished
astronomer, and an ardent disciple of “good old Izaac Walton.” As a
preacher among the Society of Friends he seems to have been most highly
esteemed, and to have been a man looked up to by the whole of that body.</p>

<p>In 1780, Cookworthy, then seventy-five, died in the same house in Nutt
Street, Plymouth, which he had occupied from the time of his first
starting in life, and a touching “testimony” to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span> character was
given by the “monthly meeting.” He was interred with every mark of
respect at Plymouth, and his memory is still warmly cherished in the
locality.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Plymouth Earthenware.</i>—The manufacture of chinaware having
ceased in Plymouth in 1774 this useful and elegant art was lost to the
town. Some years later rough common brown and yellow earthenware was
made here. In addition to these, manufactories of fine “Queen’s Ware,”
and painted, printed, and enamelled ware, were established in 1810.</p>

<p>In 1815 there were three separate manufactories in Plymouth. The
proprietors of these various potteries were Mr. Fillis, Mr. Algar, and
Mr. Hellyer.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Plymouth Pottery Company.</i>—Mr. Wm. Alsop (who made coarse ware
near the Gas Works) built a manufactory for fine earthenware of the
ordinary commoner quality, but afterwards removed to Swansea, his
works passing into the hands of Messrs. Bryant, Burnell, and James.
Subsequently Mr. Alsop returned from Swansea and formed a Limited
Liability Company for the carrying on of this concern, and produced
large quantities of the common classes of pottery and printed goods.
On the death of Mr. Alsop a Mr. Bishop, from the Staffordshire pottery
district, took the management of the works, but the manufacture
gradually died out, and about 1863 the plant was sold off and the place
disposed of to the Gas Company. The mark used by this company was the
Queen’s Arms, with the words “P.P. COY. L. (Plymouth Pottery Company
Limited.) Stone China.” The quality of the ware was of the commonest
description of white earthenware, blue printed in various patterns.
There is at the present time a manufactory of common brown ware,
carried on by Mr. Hellyer.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Watcombe.</h3>

<p><i>Watcombe Pottery.</i>—The works at Watcombe, St. Mary Church, about
two miles from Torquay, in Devonshire, were established in 1869, and
have made more rapid progress in the time than any other manufactory
on record. Their establishment owes its origin to the discovery a few
years ago, by G. T. Allen, Esq., of Watcombe House, of a bed of the
finest plastic clay, of considerable extent and depth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span></p>

<p>This discovery was made while excavating behind his residence, and
Mr. Allen, who is a gentleman of great learning and of refined
taste, and who is son of Dr. Allen, Bishop of Ely, and was the last
Master of Dulwich College before the late changes made in that
institution, took immediate steps to have its qualities for ceramic
purposes tested. A company was immediately afterwards formed for the
getting and sale of the terra-cotta clay to various potters; but,
after experiments had been made, and its unique beauty, when worked,
discovered, it was wisely resolved to erect a pottery on the spot, and
to convert the clay immediately from the pits into Art-manufactures
and architectural enrichments. Shortly afterwards, the company were
fortunate enough to secure the services of Mr. Charles Brock, of
Hanley, in Staffordshire—a gentleman of the most enlightened taste,
and of the most extensive practical knowledge—to become the manager
and Art-director of the concern. Mr. Brock at once turned his attention
to the development of the resources of the clay thus fortunately
discovered; and having brought together a number of skilled workmen
and workwomen from the Staffordshire potteries, and procured the
best possible models and modellers, soon produced Art-works which
are quite unequalled in this country, in works of this character and
material. At the present time about one hundred persons are employed
at the Watcombe works, and there can be but little doubt that, as
they are yet quite in their infancy, that number will be considerably
increased as their resources become more developed. The Watcombe clay
is remarkably fine, clean, and pure; and, with skilful manipulation,
and the requisite degree of heat in firing, has a warmth, delicacy, and
pureness of colour, and an evenness of tint, that is very gratifying to
the eye; while the surface in the “turned” specimens is fine, smooth,
and almost velvety to the touch. It is capable of being modelled into
raised flowers and other ornaments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span> and is eminently adapted for most
decorative purposes. Many of the borders and pressed ornaments have
almost the sharpness, as they have quite the general effect, of those
made of jasper body; indeed, many of the productions bear a very strong
and marked general resemblance, in appearance, to those of jasper ware;
and they are superior in many respects to the much-vaunted terra cotta
of France and Germany.</p>

     <p class="p0 center sm">Figs. 727 to 733.—Watcombe Terra Cotta.</p>
  </div>

<p>The Art-productions of the Watcombe pottery are extremely varied, and
show how capable this local clay is of being turned to good account in
a variety of ways. Among the more notable productions are statuettes
and busts, for which the clay is peculiarly suitable. Of these, the
difficult figure of “The Disc Thrower” is one of the most successful,
both in modelling, in firing, and in all the other manipulative
processes. Another artistic statuette is a sweetly pretty figure of
a country girl, bare-footed and reclining. Her right hand holds up
her apron filled with flowers, while in her left she holds an open
book, which she is intently reading. The conception of the figure,
simple and graceful in the highest degree, is remarkably good, and
the execution is free and artistic. In others, a charming effect is
produced by leaving the figure itself of the natural red of the body,
and introducing a lighter tinted clay for the drapery in which they
are partly enveloped; this, again, being lighted up and relieved here
and there with a slight touch of colour. Among the busts are a pair
of Byron and Scott—two of the most popular subjects that could be
produced—and of full life-size, being about two feet six inches in
height, and two feet in width. In modelling, these busts are among
the most easy, graceful, and life-like we have ever seen, either in
marble, in parian, or in any other material, while as productions in
warm-tinted terra-cotta they surpass anything yet produced. They are
not only life-like portraits of these two great and widely-different
types of men, as regards features and figure and pose, but they
convey an actual reflex of the mind of each in the expression which
the modeller has caught and perpetuated. The tint of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span> Watcombe
terra-cotta is a delicate rich warm red, with what may be truly called
a “bloom” overspreading its surface. It is, therefore, on that account,
as well as for its matchless fineness and purity, eminently adapted
for busts and statuary; and, for such large size busts as the pair we
are writing about, it is infinitely superior to any other material.
The vases, which are made in endless variety, are characterized by
extreme chasteness and elegance of outline, and by excellent taste
in decoration, whether that decoration consists in festoons of
hand-modelled flowers, in pressed work, in milling, in printing, or
in painting. Many of them in form and in ornamentation, although
of so different a body, bear comparison with the better specimens
of Wedgewood-ware, and exhibit a purity of taste which is quite
refreshing. For tea or déjeuné services, the insides of the teapots and
cream-ewers are simply, but judiciously glazed; while the cups are, as
in some old oriental examples, lined with celeste, which colour is also
occasionally introduced with good taste, on the handles and mouldings.
Brackets, of charming design, candlesticks, jugs, medallions,
tobacco-jars, spill-cases, flower-stands—and, indeed, all the articles
produced—bear the same stamp of care and elegance. The turning is done
with admirable precision; the moulding with a refreshing delicacy of
finish; and the gilding and enamelling—only sparsely introduced, by
the way, and then only as an accessory to the general design—executed
with a pure taste and by a master mind. Besides these, it is necessary
to mention that architectural decorations and enrichments, statues,
garden and flower-vases, pedestals, and garden edgings, besides other
articles, are made; the commoner strata of clay being remarkably well
adapted, from its hardness and durability, for these purposes. Our
engravings convey but a very poor idea of the beauty and elegance of
form of the vases, &amp;c., here produced; the purest taste characterizes
the various articles. The works are carried on by a company, under the
style of “The Watcombe Terra Cotta Clay Company,” consisting of seven
proprietors. They are situate about two miles from Torquay, on the
Teignmouth Road, near to the picturesque rocks and downs of Watcombe.
Large show-rooms have been erected, and everything done to make the
Watcombe works attractive and useful. They have been visited by, and
received the patronage of, many distinguished persons. The marks
used by the company are simply impressed in the body of the ware, or
printed on its surface. The usual mark is simply the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span> words “Watcombe,
Torquay,” or “Watcombe;” but another, and very picturesque mark has
also been adopted—it is a woodpecker on a branch of a tree, with a
distant landscape and ship on the sea, within a garter, on which are
the words, <span class="allsmcap">WATCOMBE TORQUAY</span>.</p>

<p class="center sm">WATCOMBE,<br>

<h3 class="smcap">Honiton.</h3>

<p>A manufactory of common brown and red ware existed here in the early
part of the present century, but has long been discontinued. Its
productions were for ordinary domestic use—the common “cloam” of the
country—and consisted of pans, pitchers, pancheons, porringers, &amp;c.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Exeter.</h3>

<p>In <i>Felix Farley’s Bristol Journal</i> of December 29th, 1764, is the
following:—“We hear that a few gentlemen of fortune have undertaken to
set up a new manufactory of china at Exeter.” Probably rumour was all,
for as yet I have found nothing to lead to the inference that the works
were ever established.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Bovey Tracey.</h3>

<p>The great source of Devonshire clay used in most of the potteries of
the kingdom is the district near the estuary of the river Teign. This
clay is known by various names—“Black clay,” “Ball clay,” “Devonshire
clay,” “Kingsteignton clay,” or “Potter’s clay;” and is sent off in
immense quantities to the various seats of earthenware manufacture. Yet
in the whole of this district where the clay is raised, and one would
expect to find earthenware extensively made, only one pottery exists,
and that one not on a large scale. Coal, which is such an important
item in the manufacture of earthenware, is wanting in the district;
and it is found more economical and advantageous to take the clay to
the coal, than to bring the coal to the clay. Although no true coal is
found in this district (that is, coal of the Carboniferous formation),
a lignite is found on Bovey Heath field. The beds of this lignite crop
out in a line running east and west for about the length of half a
mile in the vicinity of the present Bovey Tracey Pottery Works. In the
middle of the last century these beds had been but little worked, and
lignite could easily be obtained by open pits. In consequence of the
sandy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span> and soft nature of the beds which alternate with the lignite,
it has been found impossible to work underground on the plan adopted
in ordinary coal-mines. The raising of Bovey lignite has, therefore,
been almost given up—all the coal near the surface having been worked
out. The existence of a cheap fuel in the proximity of the potters’
clay no doubt led to the establishment of potteries at Bovey Tracey.
This lignite is a light bituminous coal which occurs in the Miocene
formation, being the same geological formation in which the potters’
clay is found. This lignite is highly gaseous, but only possesses about
a third of the heat-giving power of average English coal. It is the
same as the Norwegian “Surturbrand,” and emits a disagreeable odour in
burning. Large pieces of fir-trees are occasionally found perfect in it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Indiho Pottery.</i>—About 1772 a pottery was established at Indiho,
or Indio, or Indeo, in the parish of Bovey Tracey, and continued to be
worked until 1841, when it was superseded by the Bovey Pottery, which
had been established a few years previously to that time. The Indiho
Pottery was a small manufactory, and is supposed to have been commenced
by one George Tufnell, and was afterwards in the hands of proprietors
of the names of Inglett and Steer. About the beginning of the present
century a really good earthenware was made at Indio; the printed ware
was of a superior class, and some tea and coffee cups of a brown body
with an interior enamelled with white slip and painted outside with
small sprigs are characteristic and pretty. Nothing remains of the
buildings of the manufactory at Indio—a modern house, the seat of
Charles Aldenburgh Bentinck, Esq., standing on its site.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Bovey Pottery.</i>—The first pottery at Bovey Tracey was not on
the site of the present pottery known under this name, but was carried
on in some houses, which are parish property, near the modern railway
station. The house is at present a carpenter’s shop, and is at a corner
just where the road turns off to the Bovey Heathfield. Tradition states
that this pottery had mills to grind materials close to Bovey Bridge,
and the remains of a mill and water-wheel existed on the left bank
of the stream up to 1844. These works were carried on by a family of
the name of Ellis; they were probably commenced in the earlier half
of the eighteenth century and certainly were in work in 1755, and
lasted for thirty years after that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span> period. Nothing certain is known
of the character of the ware of this first attempt at Bovey Tracey.
Clay pipes are said to have been made, and jugs of a yellow body
which are attributed to this period are to be found in houses in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>In 1842 the Bovey Pottery was purchased by two Devonshire gentlemen,
Captain Buller and Mr. J. Divett, who enlarged the works, and obtained
the lignite from underground workings. The supply of this substance,
however, proving insufficient for the increased requirements of the
manufacture, ordinary coal was substituted in its stead; and, after the
opening of a railway to the works, Somersetshire coal has been used to
the entire exclusion of the lignite. The works are still carried on by
Messrs. Buller and Divett, under the style of the “Bovey Tracey Pottery
Company.” In general character they are similar to those of the pottery
district, and on the average five glost-ovens are fired each week.
The quality of the ware is about equal to the ordinary and commoner
classes of Staffordshire goods. It consists of all the ordinary
services and articles in white, printed, and coloured wares, and is
principally supplied to the home markets in the West of England, and to
Mediterranean ports.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>The Folly Pottery.</i>—Another pottery in Bovey Tracey parish was
the “Folly Pottery.” This pottery may be looked upon as the origin
of the present Bovey Tracey Pottery. No doubt the site was chosen
for its proximity to the main outcrop of the lignite. Considerable
uncertainty exists as to the date of this manufacture. It was probably
commenced in the last years of the eighteenth or the first years of
the nineteenth century by a man of the name of Mead. It was then for
a considerable period contemporaneous with the Indio Pottery. The
earthenware, however, seems hardly, at any time, to have equalled in
quality that of the last-named pottery. In 1835 the works were carried
on by Messrs. John and Thomas Honeychurch. It is thus described in an
advertisement of sale:—“To be sold by public auction, as directed by
the assignees of John and Thomas Honeychurch, bankrupts, at the Union
Inn, Bovey Tracey, on the 2nd May, 1836, the Folly Pottery, situate
in the parish of Bovey Tracey, in the county of Devon. This may be
designated one of the largest and most complete potteries in the West
of England, 14 miles from Exeter and 28 from Plymouth; its situation
being in the land of clay, from which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span> nearly all the potteries in
Staffordshire draw their supply, with coal-mine and railroad, &amp;c.” The
advertisement, after giving particulars regarding the processes, &amp;c.,
speaks of a glost-kiln, and a biscuit-kiln, capable of containing 1,600
saggers of ware; flint kilns; a quantity of Cornish clay and flints,
copper-plates, moulds, &amp;c. No purchaser was found until 1842, when the
concern was bought by Captain Buller and Mr. J. Divett, and converted
into the “Bovey Tracey Pottery Company,” as last described.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Bideford.</h3>

<p>Pot works appear to have existed at Bideford ever since the fourteenth
century, but nothing beyond the ordinary coarse earthenware has been
produced. Nothing is known as to the early history of these works, but
fragments of ware of mediæval character have not unfrequently been dug
up. An interesting relic, a chimney-pot, is in the possession of Mr.
Crocker. It is of square form, and bears the name “Bideford,” and the
date “1668.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>The Bideford Old Pottery</i>, belonging to Mr. W. H. Crocker,
has been in the possession of himself and his ancestors for more
than a century, but of late years its productions, under the present
proprietor, have received a marked improvement. The works were almost
entirely rebuilt, and much extended, in 1870.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image346">

     <p class="p0 center sm">Fig. 734.—Earthenware Ovens.</p>
  </div>

<p>Ornamental goods are to some extent made, and consist of garden vases,
edgings, jugs, and other articles. Flower-pots, sea-kale and rhubarb
pots, chimney tops, &amp;c., are also largely made.</p>

<p>The great specialty, however, of the productions are the fire-clay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
ovens, which are made in considerable numbers and of various sizes.
They are of peculiar shape, and so constructed as to retain the heat
for a considerable time. Their form may be said, in some measure,
to approximate to the old <i>couvre-feu</i>, as will be seen by the
engraving (Fig. <a href="#image346">734</a>). The bottom is flat, and the walls, which are of
great strength and thickness, are arched, so that the heat is thrown
upon the bread in every direction. In front is a loose fire-clay
door made to fit with exactness; or, occasionally, a cast-iron door
is fixed. These ovens are heated with gorse, or wood, and one bundle
of either is said to be sufficient to thoroughly bake three pecks of
dough. The ovens are, and for generations have been, in much repute
in Devonshire and Cornwall, and in the Welsh districts, and the bread
baked in them is said to have a sweeter and more wholesome flavour than
when baked in ordinary ovens. They are ornamented in a primitive manner
with impressed and incised lines, and the mark used is the proprietor’s
name</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>North Devon Pottery.</i>—This pottery was established in 1848
by a company formed for the purpose. The productions are confined
to stoneware pipes, and sanitary appliances of various kinds. The
goods are made from the strong clay deposits of the northern side of
Dartmoor—a clay of peculiar hardness and tenacity—and the articles
are therefore what may be called “real vitrified stone ware,” as
distinguished from the pipes and sanitary goods made in other districts
from fire-clay. The works are under the management of Mr. Henry Jones.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Fremington.</h3>

<p>The manufacture of coarse brown ware has evidently been carried on
for many generations at Fremington, near Barnstaple, for fragments of
mediæval and later wares are constantly being turned up. About fifty
years ago the remains of five old potteries, which could not have been
worked for, at least, a century, existed near the present manufactory.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>The Pottery</i>, at Fremington, was established in the early part of
the present century by Mr. George Fishley, who, in 1839, was succeeded
by his son Edmund Fishley, who continued it until his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span> death in 1861,
when it passed into the hands of his son, Mr. Edwin B. Fishley, the
present proprietor.</p>

<p>The goods produced are of the ordinary glazed red ware, and consist
principally of pitchers and jars; scalding-pans for milk, for producing
the world-famed “Devonshire cream”; flower-pots and pans; washing pots,
cauldrons, and ewe pans; baking dishes and bread pans; salting vessels
and chimney pots, and many other articles. Some of the water pitchers
bear the peculiar names of “Long Toms,” “Thirty Tales,” “Gullymouths,”
&amp;c. Yellow-ware jugs and other domestic vessels are also made.</p>

<p>In ornamental wares some good designs in jars, beer jugs, and vases
are produced. These are formed of a body of red clay, with figures and
flowers in white clay. They are sometimes coloured, with good effect.
The beer jugs, which are a speciality of the works, are generally white
with drawings in red, of the same colour as the body.</p>

<p>The great speciality of the Fremington Pottery, like that of Bideford,
is the manufacture of fire-clay ovens. These are made of various sizes
for baking from one peck up to twelve. Their general form will be best
understood from Fig. <a href="#image346">734</a>. The material of which they are composed
is remarkably firm, hard, and compact, and retains the heat for a
considerable time. These ovens, which are a peculiarity of the West
of England and of some of the Welsh districts, are simply enclosed
in raised brickwork, leaving the mouth open to the front. They are
heated in the inside with wood or gorse, and are remarkable for the
small quantity of fuel that is required—two pennyworth of wood being
said to be amply sufficient to bake seven or eight shillings’ worth of
flour. The bread is stated to be of a peculiarly wholesome and sweet
character. The mark used on the ovens, &amp;c., is simply the proprietor’s
name impressed in the clay while moist. On the ornamental ware the name
is written on the bottom of the ware.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Aller.</h3>

<p><i>The Aller Pottery.</i>—These works, near Newton Abbot, were
commenced for the manufacture of common brown ware in 1865, and three
years later came into the hands of Messrs. John Phillips &amp; Co., by
whom they are still carried on, for the production of architectural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
pottery. The goods manufactured consist of flooring and roofing
tiles, sanitary and sewage ware, garden edgings, ornamental chimney
pots, decorative bricks, flower vases, &amp;c., and various other kinds
of fire-clay goods. The markets principally supplied are those of
Devonshire, Somersetshire, and Cornwall.</p>

<p>The mark is a horse’s head, couped, with the Greek words ΦIΛΕΩ ΙΠΠΟΝ,
being a playful allusion to the name of the proprietor, “Phillips.”</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Pednandrea, Redruth.</h3>

<p><i>Crucible Works.</i>—These works at Pednandrea and at Fore Street,
Redruth, were established about 1760 by John Juleff, and carried on by
him until his decease, when he was succeeded by his son, John Juleff,
by whom they were continued until 1875. In that year he died and the
works passed into the hands of his two sons, by whom they are still
carried on under the style of “John and David Juleff.” The firm are the
only manufacturers of the original Cornish crucibles, which have always
had, and still maintain, the reputation of being the best articles
made for dry assaying and for standing intense heat. They are made to
a large extent and sent to most parts of the world. The firm also make
mufflers, scorifiers, special bricks and covers for assay furnaces,
plumbago crucibles for tin assaying, plumbago brass melting pots, &amp;c.,
of various shapes and sizes. Mr. Juleff received honourable mention for
his goods at the 1861 Exhibition: there being no competition in these
specialities, no medal could be awarded. The goods are usually marked
with the name of the firm.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Bristol.</h3>

<p>The first record of pot-making in Bristol appears to have been in the
reign of Edward I., but it seems certain that vessels were made in the
neighbourhood in Saxon and Norman times, as well as in the earlier
Celtic and Romano-British periods. Mediæval earthenware vessels of
different periods, and probably made in the locality, have now and then
been found at Bristol, and during the reign of Elizabeth, there is no
doubt, a manufactory of fictile vessels was in operation.</p>

<p>“Six hundred years ago,” says Mr. Owen, “the art of pottery was
practised in Bristol, but in what form is beyond our speculation. The
record, though authentic, is too terse to give more than the bare
fact, and the imagination must be fertile indeed that can supply the
details. The Governor of Bristol Castle, under Edward I., in his
accounts, preserved in the Pipe Roll for the twelfth year of that
reign (1284), has an item—‘<i>pro terra fodienda ad vasa fictilia
facienda</i>’—which shows that this claim for high antiquity is
well founded.” Fragments of some curious pitchers and other mediæval
domestic vessels are engraved by Mr. Owen, and appear to be of about
the period alluded to.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>The Delft Works.</i>—At the close of the seventeenth century, Delft
ware was made here, and continued to be produced until about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span> the
time when porcelain began to be produced in the city. Many specimens
of Bristol Delft ware have come under my notice, some of which are,
fortunately, dated. The earliest dated example I have seen is a plate
marked on the rim with the initials S · M · B,
and the date 1703, thus—<img src="images/image351b.jpg" alt=""
style="height:2.5em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">
. The ware is of a very nice
quality, with a good glaze, and the blue of good colour. The next dated
specimen, in chronological order, which has come under my notice is a
Delft high-heeled shoe, or choppine, which is dated on the sole 1722,
along with the initials M S—thus
<img src="images/image351c.jpg" alt=""
style="height:2em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">
This very good example, which is said to be of Bristol make, was in
possession of the late Mr. James, of that city. It is beautifully
formed, has a buckle in front, and is flowered and bordered in blue.
Two of these Delft stands in the form of high-heeled shoes, formerly
belonging to Queen Charlotte, were sold at the Bernal sale. They were
of an earlier date, and marked M I 1705. Another example in the same
possession is a plate of the year 1740, bearing on its rim the initials
R · S · P, thus—
<img src="images/image351g.jpg" alt=""
style="height:2em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;"></p>

     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center sm">Fig. 735.—Edkins’ Plate, belonging to Mr. Owen.</p>
  </div>

<p>One of the latest dated examples I have seen is the plate engraved on
Fig. <a href="#image351d">735</a>, which forms part of a set belonging to a descendant of the
artist who painted it, and has remained in the family from the time of
its manufacture until it came into my hands. It is a plate painted in a
somewhat peculiar style, in blue, with a Chinese figure, trees, cattle,
and birds, and having on its under side the date 1760, and the initials
M · B · E, as shown on Fig. <a href="#image351h">736</a>. These are the initials of Michael and
Betty Edkins, of Bristol, of whom I shall have more to say presently.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image351h">

    src="images/image351h.jpg"
     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center sm">Fig. 736.</p>
  </div>

<p>It may be well to remark, <i>en passant</i>, that this mode of placing
initials, which is so usual on traders’ tokens, was the favourite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
way of arranging the initials of husband and wife, and they were so
understood without using the short &amp;. The upper letter was the initial
of the surname, and those below of the Christian names of the husband
and wife. Thus
<img src="images/image352a.jpg" alt=""
style="height:1.8em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">
would read M &amp; B E, and stand for Michael and Betty Edkins.</p>

<p>The Delft ware works were situated on “Redcliffe Backs,” near to the
glass works of Messrs. Little and Longman. The names of the first
potters are, as usual, lost, but in the early part of last century
the works belonged to a Mr. Richard Frank, who seems to have been
a man of standing in the place, and who employed, along with other
workmen, a Mr. Thomas Patience, and a family of the name of Hope.
Richard Frank, who had also works at Brislington, was the son of
Thomas Frank, “gallipot maker,” of Bristol, who was married in 1697;
he, the “gallipot maker,” is therefore the earliest recorded potter of
this place. The goods produced at Richard Frank’s manufactory—who,
as well as his father, is described as a “gallipot maker” in 1734–9
and 1754—were principally plates, dishes, and “Dutch tiles” for
fire-places, dairies, &amp;c. In the Museum of Practical Geology is a slab
composed of twenty-four tiles, on which is painted in blue a view of
St. Mary Redcliffe Church, Bristol. These were made by Richard Frank,
about 1738–50, and the arms of Bishop Butler appear upon one of them.
The tiles were all, of course, painted by hand, and we have it on the
authority of Michael Edkins, himself the actual painter of the plate,
Fig. <a href="#image351d">735</a>, that the brushes which he and the other workmen used were
made by themselves from the hairs pulled from the nostrils and eyelids
of cattle. Michael Edkins, the painter of Delft ware, was, it appears,
from Birmingham, where he was apprenticed to a house painter. His
master dying before his term expired, he was of course left to shift
for himself, and made his way to Bristol, where, becoming acquainted
with Patience and Hope, he got employed at Frank’s pottery, where he
became a “pot painter,” and continued in that employment till the Delft
pottery declined, “when (in 1761) he became a coach and general painter
and decorator, and quickly rose to eminence, was employed about most
public works in the city, assisted in painting the bas-reliefs to the
altar-piece of St. Mary Redcliffe, and also assisted Hogarth in fixing
his celebrated pictures in that altar-piece.” He was also a successful
actor at the theatre. One branch of his business that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span> he now followed
was “enamelling glass ware,” which he did for Little and Longmans,
and their successors, Vigor and Stevens, whose glass house adjoined
the Delft pottery on Redcliffe Backs. The works stood on what is now,
at the time I write, Redcliffe Wharf, occupied by Mr. Cripps, general
wharfinger, on the river Avon.</p>

<p>A plate bearing the words “Nugent only 1754,” was in all probability
made by Richard Frank, who was a supporter of Nugent at the general
election of that year. Another plate, commemorating the same year’s
election for Tewkesbury, is supposed to be from the same works; it
bears the words “Calvert and Martin For Tukesbury 1754 Sold by Webb.”
Among other dated examples of Bristol Delft are the following, which
may be from Frank’s pottery. A piece bearing the words “Ye 1<sup>st</sup>
Sept<sup>r</sup> 1761 Bowen · fecit;” a pair of plates made for a member of the
family of Davis, with the letters

<p>“Hannah Hopkins Born Sep 17 New Style 1752,” occurs on a christening
bowl in the Edkins collection.</p>

<p>A fine plate, painted by Bowen, engraved on Fig. <a href="#image354">738</a>, is in possession
of Mr. Willet, of Brighton, who also possesses a grand tile picture,
consisting of seventy-two tiles, painted with Hogarth’s “March to
Finchley.” Mr. Fry has two clever tile pictures of nine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span> tiles each,
one representing a cat and the other a dog. On the collar of the latter
are the words “<i>Bristol</i>, 1752.”</p>

<p>Later on Richard Frank took his son Thomas into partnership, and in
1777 the works were removed to Water Lane, to the manufactory which,
in 1775, had been carried on by James Alsop, a brown stoneware potter.
The following advertisement, of the year 1777, refers to this change:
“Richard Frank &amp; Son, Earthen and Stone Pot Works, are removed from
Redcliffe Backs to Water Lane, where they continue the same business in
all its branches.”</p>

<p>In 1784, Joseph Ring, rectifier and vinegar maker, who had married
Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Frank (and was father of Sarah, the
wife of Frederick Cookworthy,[&emsp;&emsp;] nephew of William Cookworthy),
purchased the business of Frank and Son for £669 1<i>s.</i> 3½<i>d.</i>
Mr. Owen prints the following extracts from the valuation for this
sale. It shows that Richard Frank and Son were general dealers in all
kinds of ware, as well as Delft and stone ware makers. The inventory is
headed, “The Stock &amp; Utensils in Trade At the Pot House in Water Lane,
Bristol, as Appraised as following.” The following are some of the
items; the whole of the plant being valued at only ten pounds:—</p>

<p>Richard Frank died in 1785, aged about 73, and was buried in the
Quaker’s ground at Redcliffe Pit. “Joseph Ring, successor to Richard
Frank in the Pottery Business,” in his address stated that he
“continues the manufactory of the Bristol Stone Ware, and sells all
other sorts of Queen’s and other Ware wholesale and retail.” This last
branch of his business he cultivated considerably, and appears to have
traded with most of the manufacturers of the day. In 1786 Mr. Ring
determined upon manufacturing Queen’s ware, and to that end engaged
Anthony Hassel (or Hassells), a potter of Shelton, in Staffordshire,
buying from him his stock and moulds, and removing them to Bristol.</p>

  </div>

<p>In 1788 Mr. Ring took two partners, Mr. Taylor and Mr. Carter, he
bringing in a capital of £3,000, and Messrs. Taylor and Carter £1,500
jointly. “The Stock and Utensils in Trade at the Pot House in Water
Lane, as per Inventory taken this day,” January 9th, 1788, were sold by
Mr. Ring to himself and partners, “under the firm of Ring and Taylor,”
for £2038 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> The manufacture of Delft ware then
came to a close.</p>

<p>Another Delft ware potter was Joseph Flower, who, in 1775<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span> lived at
No. 2 on the Quay, and in 1777 removed to 3 Corn Street, where he put
a sign-board, painted black, with “Flower, Potter,” in gold letters,
for the painting of which he paid Michael Edkins 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
Flower’s ware, says Mr. Owen, is thinner and neater in make than most
British Delft; the glaze good, and the colour clear and brilliant in
tone—indeed, in no respect inferior to Dutch. Fig. <a href="#image355">739</a> is a plate
belonging to a dinner service made by Joseph Flower, and now in the
possession of his descendant Mr. J. Flower Fussel. It is painted with
a Chinese pattern, and bears initial and dates varying from 1742 to
1750. The plate here engraved bears the initials (Fig. <a href="#image356">740</a>). In the
same hands is a plate dated 1741–2, painted with a view of the river
Avon and the old Hotwells House; and two dishes bearing the plan of
a battle, and the words “The taking of Chagre in the West Indies by
Admiral Vernon.”</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Bristol China.</h3>

<p>The first mention of the making of china in Bristol occurs in a letter
of Richard Champion, dated February 26, 1766. In July, 1765, a box of
“porcelain earth” “from the internal part of the Cherokee nations, 400
miles from hence (Charles Town), on mountains scarcely accessible,”
was consigned to him, by his brother-in-law, to be forwarded to the
Worcester china works to be used there in experiments. The letter of
advice was dated Charles Town, 1765. At the same time another box of
this earth was sent to Champion for the Earl of Hyndford, who desired
Champion to open it and try experiments, or give it to Thomas Goldney
“who is a very curious gentleman.” In the letter of February 28th
Champion, writing to Lloyd, by whom it was consigned, says Mr. Goldney
has declined the clay. “I therefore,” he adds, “had it tried at a
manufactory set up here some time ago on the principle of the Chinese
porcelain; but not being successful is given up.” “The proprietors of
the work in Bristol imagined they had discovered in Cornwall all the
materials similar to the Chinese; but though they burnt the body part
tolerably well, yet there were impurities in the glaze or stone, which
were insurmountable even in the greatest fire they could give it, and
which was equal to a glass-house heat.” These works he had personally,
in November, 1765, spoken of as “a new work just established,” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
says, “this new work is from a clay and stone discovered in Cornwall,
which answers the description of the Chinese; but in burning there is a
deficiency, though the body is perfectly white within but not without,
which is always smoaky. This clay is very much like, but not quite so
fine as the Cherokee; however there can be no chance of introducing
the latter as a manufacture when it can be so easily procured from
Cornwall.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> This “new work” which had been tried and failed was
doubtless connected with Cookworthy of Plymouth. In 1764 he is spoken
of as “the first inventor of the Bristol china works.” Champion, at
all events, it is clear from the letters, had nothing to do with it,
and probably his first idea of making china was got from the fact of
the box of porcelain earth being consigned to him for the Worcester
works. In March, 1768, Cookworthy, the discoverer of the material,
the mainspring in all those matters, and the first to try experiments
and bring to a successful issue the manufacture of porcelain from
the Cornish materials he had found, took out his patent.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Soon
after this the manufacture of china was again commenced in Bristol by
Richard Champion. In 1771 a china manufactory, carried on by “William
Cookworthy &amp; Co.,” appears to have been in operation in Castle
Green—the “Co.,” there can be no reasonable doubt, being Richard
Champion and others. In May, 1774, William Cookworthy assigned his
patent right, &amp;c., to Champion, and the Plymouth manufactory, which had
probably been previously removed to Bristol, was finally closed; in the
rate-books the firm being, from 1773 to 1780, “Richard Champion &amp; Co.,”
in 1781 “Richard Champion” only; and in the following year the premises
are stated to have been occupied by a pipe-maker named J. Carey.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Every circumstance investigated,” says Mr. Owen, in his
valuable work “Ceramic Art in Bristol,” “proves that Champion
first commenced china-making under licence from the patentee
(Cookworthy). Mr. Edward Brice advanced £1,000 in aid of the
work in February, 1768; the partnership in 1768 consisted of
Richard Champion, Joseph Harford, and Thomas Winwood”—Harford
contributing £3,000 to the capital. On the 1st February, 1769,
the partnership was dissolved. Mr. Joseph Fry, without being
a partner, is also stated to have contributed £1,500 to the
scheme. In 1771 an advertisement of “Some beautiful dessert
services, ornamental figures, candlesticks, and many other
valuable articles of the Bristol manufactory,” were advertised
to be on sale “on retail at Taylor’s Hall” in that city.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1772, as Mr. Owen incontestably shows, the china works were in
full operation in Bristol. On August 15th of that year the following
advertisement appeared:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“China. For Sale by Auction at the Taylors-Hall in Broad
Street, on Tuesday the 1st of September and the following
days, Useful and Ornamental China, The produce of the Bristol
Manufactory, consisting of very elegant Figures, beautiful
Vases, Jars, and beakers, with all kinds of useful China,
blue and white and enamel’d. To be sold without Reserve. J.
Stephens, auctioneer. The whole to be Viewed the Saturday and
Monday preceding the Sale, from Ten in the morning till Two,
and from Three till Six in the Afternoon. The Manufactory is
still carried on in Castle Green, where all persons may be
supplied with useful or ornamental China, Wholesale or Retail.”</p>
</div>

<p>In November, 1772, the following still more illustrative advertisement
appeared:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“China. At the Manufactory in Castle Green, Bristol, are sold
various kinds of The True Porcelain, Both Useful and Ornamental,
consisting of a new assortment. The Figures, Vases, Jars, and
Beakers are very elegant, and the useful ware exceedingly good.
As this Manufactory is not at present sufficiently known, it
may not be improper to remark that this Porcelain is wholly
free from the Imperfections in Wearing which the English China
usually has, and that its Composition is equal in fineness to
the East Indian, and will wear as well. The enamell’d Ware,
which is rendered nearly as cheap as the English blue and white,
comes very near and in some Pieces equal to Dresden, which this
work more Particularly imitates. N.B. There is some of the old
Stock, which will be sold very cheap.—Two or three careful Boys
wanted. ☞ Also at <span class="smcap">Cadell’s</span> Tea and China Shop, No. 20,
in <span class="smcap">Wine Street</span>, is to be sold Retail, on the same Terms
as at the Manufactory, a new and elegant Assortment of the above
Porcelain.”
</p>
</div>

<p>In January, 1773, as again shown by Mr. Owen, to whom the world is much
indebted for many years’ laborious searchings into every available
source of knowledge, and whom I have to thank for much information,
another advertisement appeared as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The True Porcelain, both useful and ornamental, Consisting of
a large and elegant assortment (Particularly some beautiful
Imitations of the Dresden) on any low Terms, to induce the
Public to encourage a Manufactory the first of the kind
introduced into England, and now brought to Great Perfection.
Its texture not to be distinguished from East India China,
and will wear equally well. Some of the old Stock selling
remarkably cheap.”</p>
</div>

<p>From these it is evident the Bristol works were carried on
simultaneously with those of Plymouth in the last few years of those
later works, and that, like Plymouth, “vases, jars, and beakers, very
elegant,” were produced, as well as the ordinary classes of useful
goods. In June, 1773, his prices are advertised as “Complete Tea
Sets in the Dresden taste highly ornamented £7 0<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>
to £12 12<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> and upwards. Tea Sets, 43 pieces, of
various prices as low as £2 2<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> Cups and Saucers from
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per half-dozen, and all
other sorts of useful Ware proportionately cheap.”</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the position of the manufactory at Bristol, and
by whomever—whether “W. Cookworthy &amp; Co.,” “R. Champion &amp; Co.,” or “R.
Champion” alone—it was carried on previous to that date, certain it is
that (as I have stated) in 1774 Cookworthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span> sold his patent right, &amp;c.,
to Champion, closed his Plymouth works, and from that time forth ceased
to have any connection with china making.</p>

<p>In 1774, then, “Richard Champion, of Bristol, merchant,” became
possessed of Cookworthy’s patent. The deed of assignment of the patent
rights, &amp;c., from Cookworthy to Champion, is dated May 6th, 1774,
and among other “considerations” it was covenanted that whatever
the amount of value of the raw material (the Cornish clay and stone
which Cookworthy had discovered and brought into use) Champion used
in the course of a year, an equal amount of money should be paid to
Cookworthy. For example, if, in the course of a year, Champion paid
£1000 for material in Cornwall, he would also have to pay another £1000
to Cookworthy for the privilege of using it, thus doubling the price of
the material from that at which Cookworthy had himself worked it. Of
this, however, more presently.</p>

     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center sm">Figs. 741 and 742.—Portraits of Richard Champion and
Judith his wife.</p>
  </div>

<p>Champion was, evidently, a man before his time in Bristol, enthusiastic
in everything which could tend to improve that city commercially or
otherwise, and ever ready to expend his energies and his money in
furtherance of useful schemes and beneficial manufactures. He was, it
will have been seen, just the kind of man to enter earnestly, and even
enthusiastically, into the scheme of making porcelain on a principle
that should employ native materials only, and which bid fair to be a
great and lasting benefit, not only to his city, but to the community
at large.</p>

<p>I have shown, then, that Richard Champion, in 1774, by deed of
assignment from Cookworthy, dated May 6th in that year, became the
sole proprietor of the patent right, and everything connected with the
china works, for which he covenanted, among other things, to pay to
Cookworthy, his heirs, executors, &amp;c., a profit equal to the first cost
of the raw material used in his manufactory. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span> first arrangement was
that this royalty was to be perpetual, but it was afterwards restricted
to ninety-nine years—the time of the lease for the raw materials.
Having thus become proprietor of the concern which had at one time
been carried on jointly by Cookworthy, Lord Camelford, and himself
(and probably others), he, on the 22nd of the following February,
1775, presented a petition to the House of Commons, praying for the
term of patent right to be enlarged for a further period of fourteen
years to himself. His petition was referred to a committee, which began
its sittings on the 28th of April. The following is the report of the
committee of the House of Commons upon the petition:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To prove the Allegations of the said petition, His present
Majesty’s Letters Patent, dated 17th March, 1768, granted to
<span class="smcap">William Cookworthy</span>, of Plymouth, Chymist, for the
sole use and Exercise of a Discovery of Materials, of the same
Nature as those of which the <i>Asiatic</i> and <i>Dresden</i>
Porcelain are made, were produced to your Committee and read.</p>

<p>“That an Assignment of the said Letters Patent from the said
<span class="smcap">William Cookworthy</span> to the petitioner, dated 6th May,
1774, were also Produced and read; and</p>

<p>“Mr. <i>John Britain</i> being examined, said That he has
great Experience in several China Manufactures, and has made
several Trials upon all those which had been manufactured in
<i>England</i>, and finds that all of them, except that of
<i>Bristol</i>, were destroyed in the same fire which brings
the same Bristol to Perfection.</p>

<p>“And he produced to your committee several samples of the
said kinds of China, which shewd the effect upon china
severally, and said that they had not been able to bring the
<i>Bristol</i> China to a marketable commodity so as to furnish
an order until within the last Six Months, but that sometimes
they succeeded and at other times not; but that now they can
execute any order.</p>

<p>“That they have lately made considerable Improvements in the
said manufacture, and particularly are endeavouring to perfect
the Blue, in which as yet they have not entirely succeeded,
though they have now a Gentleman who has succeeded in a small
way, in which they have been at a considerable expence; that
the witness thinks the manufacture is capable of further
improvements; that they can afford it at a price equal to
Foreign China of equal goodness; and that they have made some
Specimens equal to good <i>Dresden</i>; that he had not seen
any <i>Dresden</i> ornamental China equal to the Vases produced
to your committee, nor anything equal to the Biscuit in those
Vases and other Ornaments; that the Gilding stands well; that
<i>Seve</i> China differs from this—the Ornamental is more of
a cream colour, but the glaze is so soft that it will not bear
using; that he believes the Enamell of the <i>Bristol</i> China
is as hard as the Dresden and harder than the <i>Chinese</i>;
that they can make it of any degree of thickness required; that
there is the difference between the <i>Bristol</i> China and
the <i>Seve</i> and several other kinds, that when they are
broke they seem as dry as a Tobacco Pipe; that this is the case
of all the <i>English</i> China; but the <i>Dresden</i>, the
<i>Bristol</i>, and the <i>Asiatic</i> China have when broke
a moist and Lucid appearance, in proof of which he produced
Fragments of the several kinds. That the <i>Bristol</i> China
will stand hot water without splitting; that he has never
known an instance of it splitting, though he has known several
pieces of the <i>Asiatic</i> split; that the gold does not
come off the <i>Bristol</i>; that there are some china which
frequent use turns brown and cracks, which the Witness thinks
arises from there not being a proper Union between the Body and
the glaze; that the Manufacturers have their Glaze made into
a glass previous to its being applied to the Body, but that
that is not the case with the <i>Bristol</i>. That they can
make plates, but have had great Difficulties. That they have
not hitherto much attended to that object, but have applied
themselves to perfecting the body as a Body and the Glaze as
a glaze; that they can render this China in most Articles
as cheap as the <i>Asiatic</i>, and much cheaper than the
<i>Dresden</i>.</p>

<p>“Then the Witness produced to your committee Specimens of the
<i>Asiatic</i> and Chinese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span> materials, and said he found no
difference except that the materials of the <i>Asiatic</i>
shrunk in the Burning One 42d Part more than those of Bristol,
and judges the <i>Bristol</i> materials to be better. Then,</p>

<p>“Mr. <i>Samuel Hardensydes</i> Produced to your committee
several pieces of China which he had lately tried Experiments
on in London; and being examined, said that he had put
<i>India</i>, <i>Dresden</i>, <i>Bristol</i>, and other
<i>English</i> China into the fire in the same Crucible; that
the <i>India</i>, <i>Dresden</i>, and <i>Bristol</i> came out
in the same state they were put in; the Bristol was tried three
times and stood it; the Fire moved the Gilding into Grains, but
had no other Effect upon it; in other respects it was rather
better for the Fire.</p>

<p>“<i>Ordered</i>, That leave be given to bring in a Bill for
enlarging the Letters patent.</p>

<p>“And that Mr. <i>Frederick Montagu</i>, Mr. <i>Cruger</i>, Mr.
<i>Harris</i>, Mr. <i>Cooper</i>, the <i>Lord Clare</i>, and
Mr. <i>Eden</i>, do appear and bring in the same.”</p>
</div>

<p>By this time he had prepared and produced some remarkably fine
specimens of china made at his works, for examination by the committee,
and it is not too much to say that at this period his productions were
of the highest rank. The result of his application was the ultimate
passing of an Act of Parliament, by which the patent was accordingly
enlarged. This Act, which contains a vast deal of valuable and
interesting information, I give <i>in extenso</i>, for the benefit of
my readers.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> It was passed in 1775 (15 Geo. III., cap. 52), and is
entitled, “An Act for enlarging the term of Letters Patent granted
by his present Majesty to William Cookworthy, of Plymouth, Chymist,
for the sole use and exercise of a discovery of certain materials for
making Porcelain, in order to enable Richard Champion, of Bristol,
merchant (to whom the said Letters Patent have been assigned), to carry
the said discovery into effectual execution for the benefit of the
public.” It is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Whereas his present Majesty King George the Third has been
graciously pleased to grant his Royal Letters Patent under the
Great Seal of Great Britain unto William Cookworthy, Chymist,
in the words, or to the effect, following; that is to say:
George the Third by the grace of God of Great Britain, France,
and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, and so forth, to all

Cookworthy, of Plymouth, in the County of Devon, Chymist, has
by his petition humbly represented unto us that he hath by a
series of experiments discovered that materials of the same
nature as those of which the Asiatic porcelain is made are to
be found in immense quantities in our island of Great Britain,
which ingredients are distinguished in our two counties of
Devon and Cornwall by the names of <i>moor stone</i>, and
<i>growan</i>, and <i>growan clay</i>; that the ware which he
hath prepared from these materials hath all the character of
the true porcelain in regard to grain, transparency, colour,
and infusibility, in a degree equal to the Chinese or Dresden
ware: whereas, all the manufactures of porcelain hitherto
carried on in Great Britain have been only imitations of the
genuine kind, wanting the beauty of colour, and the smoothness
and lustre of grain, and the great characteristic of genuine
porcelain sustaining the most extreme degree of fire without
melting; that this discovery hath been attended with great
labour and expense, and, to the best of his knowledge and
belief in regard to this kingdom, is new and his own, the
materials being, even at this time, applied to none of the uses
of pottery but by him and those under his direction; and that
he verily believes this invention will be of great advantage
to the public. He, therefore, most humbly prayed us that we
should be pleased to grant him our Royal Letters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span> Patent for
the sole making and vending of this new invented porcelain,
composed of moor stone or growan, and growan clay, within
that part of our kingdom of Great Britain called England, our
dominion of Wales, and the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, for the
space of fourteen years, according to the statute in that case
made and provided: we, being willing to give encouragement to
all arts and inventions which may be for the public good, are
graciously pleased to condescend to the petitioner’s request.
Know ye, therefore, that we, of our especial grace, certain
knowledge, and meet motion, have given and granted, and for
these presents our heirs and successors do give and grant unto
the said William Cookworthy, his executors, administrators, and
assigns, our special licence, full power, sole privilege and
authority, that he, the said William Cookworthy, his executors,
administrators, and assigns, and every of them, by himself and
themselves, or by his or their deputy or deputies, servants,
or agents, or such others as the said William Cookworthy,
his executors, administrators, and assigns shall at any time
agree with, and no others, from time to time, and at all
times hereafter during the term of years herein expressed,
shall, and lawfully may make, use, exercise, and vend his said
invention within that part of Great Britain called England,
our dominion of Wales, and the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed,
and in such a manner as he, the said William Cookworthy,
his executors, administrators, and assigns, or any of them,
in their discretions seem meet; and that the said William
Cookworthy, his executors, administrators, and assigns shall,
and lawfully may, enjoy the whole profit, benefit, commodity,
and advantage from time to time coming, growing, accruing, and
arising by reason of the said invention for and during the
term of years herein mentioned, to have, hold, exercise, and
enjoy the said licence, privileges, and advantages hereinbefore
granted, or mentioned to be granted, to the said William
Cookworthy, his executors, administrators, and assigns, for
and during and to the full end of the term of fourteen years
from the date of these presents next and immediately ensuing,
and fully to be completed and ended according to the statute
in such case made and provided, and to the end that he, the
said William Cookworthy, his executors, administrators, and
assigns, and every of them, may have and enjoy the full benefit
and the sole use and exercise of the said invention, according
to our gracious intention hereinbefore declared; we do by
these presents, for us, our heirs and successors, require and
strictly command all and every person and persons, bodies
politic and corporate, and all other our subjects whatsoever,
of what estate, quality, degree, name, or condition soever they
be, within that said part of Great Britain called England,
our dominion of Wales, and our town of Berwick-upon-Tweed
aforesaid, that neither they nor any of them, at any time
during the continuance of the said term of fourteen years
hereby granted, either directly or indirectly, do make, use,
or practise the said invention or any part of the same so
attained unto by the said William Cookworthy as aforesaid,
nor in anywise counterfeit, imitate, or resemble the same,
nor shall make, or cause to be made, any addition thereunto,
or substraction from the same, whereby to pretend himself
or themselves to be the inventor or inventors, deviser or
devisers thereof, without the licence, consent, or agreement
of the said William Cookworthy, his executors, administrators,
or assigns, in writing under his or their hands and seals,
first had and obtained in that behalf, upon such pains and
penalties as can or may be justly inflicted on such offenders
for their contempt of this our Royal command; and further, to
be answerable to the said William Cookworthy, his executors,
administrators, and assigns according to law for his and their
damages thereby occasioned; and moreover, we do by these
presents, for us, our heirs, and successors, will and command
all and singular the justices of the peace, mayors, sheriffs,
bailiffs, constables, head boroughs, and all other officers
and ministers whatsoever, of us, our heirs, and successors for
the time being, that they, or any of them, do not, nor shall
at any time hereafter during the said term hereby granted the
said William Cookworthy, his executors, administrators, or
assigns, or any of them, or his or their deputies, servants, or
agents, in anywise molest, trouble, or hinder the said William
Cookworthy, his executors, administrators, and assigns, or any
of them, or his or their deputies, servants, or agents, in
or about the due and lawful use or exercise of the aforesaid
invention or anything relating thereto: Provided always, and
these our Letters Patent are and shall be upon this condition,
that if at any time during the said term here granted, it
shall be made to appear to us, our heirs, or successors, or
any six or more of our or their Privy Council, that this our
grant is contrary to law, or prejudicial or inconvenient to
our subjects in general, or that if the said invention is not
a new invention as to the public use and exercise thereof, in
that part of our kingdom of Great Britain called England, our
dominion of Wales, and town of Berwick-upon-Tweed aforesaid,
or not invented or found out by the said William Cookworthy as
aforesaid,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span> then, upon signification or declaration thereof,
to be made by us, our heirs and successors, under our or their
signet or Privy Seal, or by the lords of our or their Privy
Council, or any six or more of them under their hand, these
our Letters Patent shall forthwith cease, determine, and be
utterly void to all intents and purposes, anything hereinbefore
contained in anywise notwithstanding. Provided also, that these
our Letters Patent, or anything herein contained, shall not
extend to or be construed to extend to the privileges of the
said William Cookworthy, his executors, administrators, or
assigns, or any of them, to use or imitate any invention or
work whatsoever which has heretofore been found out or invented
by any other of our subjects whatsoever, or publicly used or
exercised in that part of our kingdom of Great Britain called
England, our dominion of Wales, and town of Berwick-upon-Tweed
aforesaid, unto whom, the like Letters Patent or privileges
have already been granted for the sole use, exercise, and
benefit thereof, it being our will and pleasure that the
said William Cookworthy, his executors, administrators, and
assigns, and all and every person or persons to whom the like
Letters Patent or privileges have already been granted as
aforesaid, shall distinctly use and practice their several
inventions by them invented and found out, according to the
true intent and meaning of the said Letters Patent and of
these presents. Provided, likewise, nevertheless, and these
our Letters Patent are upon this express condition, that the
said William Cookworthy, his executors, administrators, or
assigns, or any person or persons which shall or may be at
any time or times hereafter, during the continuance of this
grant, have or claim any right, title, or intent, in law or
equity, or of, in, or to the power, privilege, and authority
of the sole use of the said benefit hereby granted, shall
make any transfer or assignment, or pretended transfer or
assignment, of the said liberty and privilege, or any share
or shares for the benefit or profit thereof, or shall declare
any trust thereof to or for any number of persons exceeding
the number of five, or shall open, or cause to be opened,
any book or books for public subscriptions to be made by
any number of persons exceeding the number of five for such
or the like intents or purposes, or shall presume to act as
a corporate body, or shall divide the benefit of these our
Letters Patent, or the liberty and privileges hereby by us
granted, into any number of shares exceeding the number of
five, or shall commit or do, or shall procure to be committed
or done, any act, matter, or thing whatsoever, during the time
such person or persons shall have any right or title, either
in law or equity, in or to the said premises which shall be
contrary to the true intent and meaning of a certain Act of
Parliament, made in the sixth year of the reign of our late
royal greatgrandfather King George the First, entituled, ‘An
Act for the better securing certain powers and privileges,
intended to be granted by his Majesty by two charters, for the
Insurance of Ships and Merchandize by Sea, and for laying money
out upon bottoming, and for restraining several extravagant
and unwarrantable practices therein mentioned,’ or in case
the said privilege or authority shall at any time hereafter
become vested in, or in trust for, any number of more than
five persons or their representatives (reckoning executors or
administrators as for the single person whom they represent, as
to such interest as they are or shall be entitled to in right
of such testator or intestate), that then, and in any of the
said cases, these our Letters Patent, and all liberties and
advantages whatsoever hereby granted, shall utterly cease and
become void, anything hereinbefore contained to the contrary
thereof, anywise, notwithstanding. Provided also, if the
said William Cookworthy shall not particularly describe and
ascertain the nature of his invention, and in what manner the
same is to be performed, by an instrument in writing, under
his hand and seal, and cause the same to be enrolled in our
High Court of Chancery within four calendar months next and
immediately after the date of these our Letters Patent, that
then these our Letters Patent, and all liberties and advantages
whatsoever hereby granted, shall utterly cease, determine, and
become void, anything hereinbefore contained to the contrary
thereof in anywise notwithstanding. And, lastly we do by these
presents, for us, our heirs and successors, grant unto the
said William Cookworthy, his executors, administrators, and
assigns, that these, our Letters Patent, or the enrollment of
the exemplification thereof, shall be in and by all things
good, firm, valid, sufficient, and effectual in the law,
according to the true intent and meaning thereof, and shall
be taken, construed, and adjudged in the most favourable and
beneficial sense for the best advantage of the said William
Cookworthy, his executors, administrators, and assigns, as
well in all our Courts of Record as elsewhere, and by all
and singular the officers and ministers whatsoever of us,
our heirs, and successors in that part of the said kingdom
of Great Britain called England, our dominion of Wales, and
town of Berwick-upon-Tweed aforesaid, and amongst all and
every the subjects of us, our heirs, and successors whatsoever
and wheresoever, notwithstanding the not full and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span> certain
describing the nature or quality of the said invention, or
of the materials thereto conducing and belonging, in witness
whereof we have caused these our Letters to be made patent:
witness ourself, at Westminster, the seventeenth day of March,
in the eighth year of our reign.</p>

<p>“And whereas the said William Cookworthy hath by an instrument
in writing, under his hand and seal, described and ascertained
the nature of the said invention,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and the manner in which
the same is to be performed, and hath caused the same to be
enrolled in His Majesty’s High Court of Chancery within the
time and in the manner directed by the said Letters Patent;
and whereas by a deed of assignment, bearing date the sixth
day of May, One Thousand Seven Hundred and Seventy-four,
the said William Cookworthy (for the consideration therein
mentioned) hath assigned all his interest, benefit, and
property, in the said Letters Patent and invention, unto
<span class="smcap">Richard Champion</span>, of Bristol, merchant, his executors,
administrators, and assigns; and whereas the said Richard
Champion hath been at very considerable expense and great pains
and labour in prosecuting the said invention, and by reason
of the great difficulty attending the manufacture upon a new
principle, hath not been able to bring the same to perfection
until within the last year, and it will require further pains,
labour, and expense, to render the said invention of public
utility, for all which trouble and expense the said Richard
Champion will not be able to receive an adequate compensation
unless the term granted by the said royal Letters Patent be
prolonged. To the end therefore that the said Richard Champion
may be encouraged to prosecute and complete the said invention,
may it please your Majesty (at the humble petition of the said
Richard Champion) that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by
the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the consent of
the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present
Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that
all and every the powers, liberties, privileges, authorities,
rights, benefits, and advantages, which in and by the said
Letters Patent were originally given and granted to him the
said William Cookworthy, his executors, administrators, and
assigns, and no further or greater than he or the said Richard
Champion would have been entitled to if this Act had not been
made, shall be, and the same are hereby given and granted,
to the said Richard Champion, his executors, administrators,
and assigns, and shall be held, exercised, and enjoyed by him
the said Richard Champion, his executors, administrators, and
assigns, for and during the present term of fourteen years
granted by the said Letters Patent; and from and after the
end and expiration of the said term of fourteen years thereby
granted, for and during the further or additional term of
fourteen years, in as full, ample, and beneficial manner, in
all respects, and to all intents and purposes whatsoever, as
he the said Richard Champion, his executors, administrators,
and assigns, could have held and enjoyed the same under and by
virtue of the said Letters Patent for the term thereby granted,
in case the said Letters Patent had been originally granted by
his Majesty to him the said Richard Champion, his executors,
administrators, and assigns.</p>

<p>“Provided always, and be it further granted and declared by
the authority aforesaid, that if the said Richard Champion
shall not cause to be enrolled in the High Court of Chancery,
within four months after passing this Act, a specification
of the mixture and proportions of the raw materials of which
his porcelain is composed, and likewise of the mixture and
proportions of the raw materials which compose the glaze of
the same (which specification is now in the hands of the Lord
High Chancellor of Great Britain); or if the same shall not be
a true and just specification of the mixture and proportions
of the said materials, then this Act shall cease, determine,
and be absolutely void, anything hereinbefore contained to the
contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p>“Provided also that nothing in this Act contained shall be
construed to hinder or prevent any Potter or Potters, or any
other person or persons, from making use of any such raw
materials, or any mixture or mixtures thereof (except such
mixture of raw materials, and in such proportions, as are
described in the specification hereinbefore directed to be
enrolled), anything in this Act to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p>“And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that
this Act shall be adjudged, deemed, and taken to be a public
Act, and shall be judicially taken notice of as such by all
judges, justices, and other persons whomsoever, without
specially pleading the same.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span></p>

<p>Between the time, however, of the committee’s sitting and the passing
of the Act, Josiah Wedgwood, whose name is always received with
reverence by all who study the history of Ceramic Art, ostensibly as
the spokesman of the Staffordshire potters, but really at first alone,
opposed the grant, on the ground, among others, that the use of the
natural productions of the soil ought to be the right of all, and that
the restrictions would be detrimental to trade and injurious to the
public. In Wedgwood’s “memorial” against the petition of Champion,
which he presented to parliament, “Josiah Wedgwood on behalf of himself
and the manufacturers of earthenware in Staffordshire,” urges “that the
manufacture of earthenware in that county has of late received many
essential improvements, and is continually advancing to higher degrees
of perfection; that the further improvement of the manufactory must
depend upon the application and the <i>free use</i> of the various
raw materials that are the natural products of this country; that
the raw materials, now secured for a limited time to the petitioner
(Champion) may, at the expiration of the patent assigned to him, be of
great use to enable the potters throughout Great Britain to improve
their manufactures into the finest porcelain, and thereby produce a
branch of commerce of more national importance than any of this kind
hitherto established;” that Mr. Champion “was not the inventor, but the
<i>purchaser</i> only of the unexpired patent granted to another man,
who does not appear to have any interest in this application; that the
petitioner, therefore, <i>not being the original discoverer</i>, and
having purchased the remaining term of the patent at a <i>proportionate
price</i>, can have no right to expect a further extension of a
monopoly injurious to the community at large, which neither the
ingenious discoverer nor the purchaser, for want perhaps of skill and
experience in this particular business, have been able, during the
space of seven years already elapsed, to bring to any useful degree of
perfection;” and that, if he has brought his discovery to perfection,
as alleged, the unexpired term of seven years ought to be enough to
enable him to reimburse himself. To this memorial of Josiah Wedgwood’s,
Champion presented the following honourable reply:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When Mr. Champion presented a petition to the Honourable House
of Commons, praying the aid of parliament for a prolongation
of the term granted by the Patent for making porcelain, he
built his hopes of success on two circumstances: the first,
the apparent utility resulting from such a manufacture carried
to a perfection equal to that of the Dresden and Asiatic. The
second circumstance on which he grounded his expectation was
the sense which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span> he hoped the House would entertain of the
justice of compensating, by some reasonable privilege, the
great labour, expense, and risque which had been incurred, not
only in the invention of the material and composition, but in
the improvement of this important manufacture. He was also
almost certain that no person whatsoever in this kingdom could,
on a supposition of their being prejudiced in their rights in a
similar property, have had any cause of complaint, or pretence
to interfere with him, or to oppose the prayer of his petition.</p>

<p>“Mr. Champion however finds, with some surprise, that Mr.
Wedgwood, who has never hitherto undertaken any similar
manufacture, conceives himself likely to be injured by the
indulgence which Mr. Champion has solicited. He has accordingly
printed a memorial containing his reasons against the granting
the prayer of Mr. Champion’s petition, and is now actually gone
in person into Staffordshire in order to solicit others to
prefer a petition to Parliament against Mr. Champion’s bill.</p>

<p>“Before Mr. Champion replies to Mr. Wedgwood’s observations
or complaints, he begs leave to remark on the time when Mr.
Wedgwood introduces them. Mr. Champion presented his petition
to the Honourable House of Commons on the twenty-second day of
February. The committee to which that petition was referred
did not sit until the twenty-eighth day of April, during which
time Mr. Wedgwood neither made any public application against
Mr. Champion, or gave him any sort of private information
of intended opposition. Neither did any manufacturers in
Staffordshire or elsewhere express any uneasiness or make
any complaint of Mr. Champion’s application, though it is
not improbable that Mr. Wedgwood’s journey thither may be
productive of both.</p>

<p>“Mr. Champion forbore to bring forward his petition before
the committee until he had prepared such specimens of his
manufacture as might give the committee the most striking
proofs of the truths of his allegations, and this could not
be done sooner in a manufacture so very lately, and with such
incredible difficulty, brought to its present perfection. He
trusts that the specimens which he has produced in various
kinds will show that he has been usefully employed, and merits
the public protection.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wedgwood is pleased to represent his memorial on behalf of
himself and the manufacturers of earthenware in Staffordshire.
Mr. Champion says, as has been already hinted, that Mr.
Wedgwood had not any authority from such manufacturers, or any
others, to make any representations in their behalf.</p>

<p>“Mr. Champion most cheerfully joins in the general praise which
is given to Mr. Wedgwood for the many improvements which he has
made in the Staffordshire earthenware, and the great pains and
assiduity with which he has pursued them. He richly deserves
the large fortune he has made from these improvements. But
should he not be content with the rewards he has met with, and
not have the avidity to grasp at a manufacture which another
has been at as great pains as Mr. Wedgwood has employed in his
own to establish?—a manufacture entirely original in this
kingdom, and which all nations in Europe have been desirous to
obtain?</p>

<p>“Mr. Wedgwood says the application and free use of the various
raw materials of this country will make a great improvement in
the manufacture of Staffordshire earthenware. Mr. Champion has
no objection to the use which the potters of Staffordshire may
make of his or any other raw materials, provided earthenware
only, as distinguished by that title, is made from it. He wants
to interfere with no manufacture whatever, and is content to
insert any clause to confine him to the invention which he
possesses, and which he has improved. He is contented that Mr.
Wedgwood, and every manufacturer, should reap the fruit of
their labour; all he asks is, such a protection for his own as
the legislature in its wisdom shall think merits.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wedgwood’s remark on the difference of merit betwixt Mr.
Watt and Mr. Champion is ungenerous and unjust: ungenerous, as
Mr. Champion has not, or does not, compare himself to Mr. Watt;
he has not even mentioned his name in any of his applications.
His business is not with comparative or similar merits; it is
his duty to prove the merit of his own manufacture, for which
he solicits the encouragement of the legislature. He hopes
that the specimens which he has produced before the committee
are incontrovertible evidences of it. The remark is unjust,
because he has been many years concerned in this undertaking;
nearly from the time the patent was granted to Mr. Cookworthy,
in whose name it continued till assigned over to Mr. Champion.
To deny the advantage of any part of Mr. Cookworthy’s merits
to his assignee is to deny that advantage to Mr. Cookworthy
himself. One part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span> benefit of every work, from whence
profit may be derived, is the power of assignment; and if, in
fact, the manufacture could not be completed, nor the inventor,
of course, derive any profit from it, without the expense,
care, and perseverance of the assignee and once partner, the
merit of that assignee, who both completes the manufacture
and rewards the discoverer, is equal in equity to that of the
discoverer himself—equal in every respect, except the honour
that attends original genius and power of invention.</p>

<p>“Mr. Champion can assert with truth that his hazard and expense
was many times greater than those of the original inventor.
Mr. Champion mentions this without the least disparagement to
the worthy gentleman, who is his particular friend; he gives
him all the merit which was due to so great a discovery; he
deserved it for finding out the means of a manufacture which
will, in all probability, be a very great advantage to this
country; but yet Mr. Champion claims the merit of supporting
the work, and, when the inventor declined the undertaking
himself, with his time, his labour, and his fortune, improved
it from a very imperfect to an almost perfect manufacture; and
he hopes soon, with proper encouragement, to one altogether
perfect.</p>

<p>“What regards the original discoverer is, in some measure,
answered in the foregoing paragraph, but the original
discoverer is not without a reward. Mr. Champion at this moment
allows him, and is bound to his heirs, &amp;c., in a profit equal
to the first cost of the raw material, and, as Mr. Champion’s
manufactory is encouraged, must increase to a very great degree.</p>

<p>“Nor is Mr. Wedgwood more excusable for his implication that
a want of skill prevented the work being brought earlier to
perfection; undoubtedly the difficulty arose from a want of
skill in working these new materials. This is a profound as
well as civil remark of Mr. Wedgwood’s; but that skill was to
be acquired only by care and expense, and that care and expense
are Mr. Champion’s merits. Mr. Champion pretends to no other
knowledge as a potter than what he has acquired in the progress
of this manufacture, his profession of a merchant not putting
more in his power; but he had the experience of Mr. Cookworthy,
the inventor, one of the most able chemists in this kingdom,
to whom the public is indebted for many useful discoveries; he
had the experience of the manager of his works, a person bred
in the potteries, and thoroughly conversant in manufactures
of this kind; the workmen he employed were brought up to the
branch, and he has spared no expense in encouraging foreign
artificers.</p>

<p>“But Mr. Champion, as a further answer to Mr. Wedgwood’s
implication of want of skill, begs leave to observe that
the <i>Dresden</i> manufacture (like this, a native clay),
which has been established so great a number of years, was
long before it attained perfection, and even now it has not
that exact proportion of shape which the Chinese manufacture
possesses. The <i>Austrian</i> manufacture (also a native
clay) was twenty-five years before it attained any degree of
perfection, and then only by accidental aid of the Dresden
workmen who were dispersed during the late war. The work
in <i>Brandenburgh</i> is nothing more than the Dresden
materials, wrought by workmen removed hither from that city,
the Brandenburgh work having no clay of its own territory. Mr.
Champion is surprised that Mr. Wedgwood can find no cause but
one, which he chooses to blame, why a new manufacture, upon
a principle never before tried in England, should not have
attained perfection in a shorter space than the very short
space of seven years.</p>

<p>“As to Mr. Wedgwood’s calculation of the profits sufficient to
recompense the ingenuity, and repay the trouble and expense of
others, Mr. Champion submits it to a discerning and encouraging
legislature, whether a seven years’ sale is likely to repay
a seven years’ unproductive, experimental, and chargeable
labour, as well as the future improvement to grow from new
endeavours? Until Mr. Champion was able to make this porcelain
in quantities to supply a market, it was rather an object of
curiosity than a manufacture for national benefit.</p>

<p>“There is one branch of the manufacture, the <i>blue and
white</i>, upon which he has just entered—this branch is
likely to be the most generally useful of any: but the giving a
blue colour under the glaze, on so hard a material as he uses,
has been found full of difficulty. This object he has pursued
at a great expense by means of a foreign artificer; and he can
now venture to assert that he shall bring that to perfection
which has been found so difficult in Europe in native clay.</p>

<p>“If the various difficulties which have attended his work from
its beginning could have been foreseen, this patent ought
not to have been applied for at so early a period. The time
in which profit was to be expected has necessarily been laid
out in experiment. It was thought that when the principle
was found, the work was done; but the perfecting a chemical
discovery into a merchantable commodity has been found a
troublesome and a tedious work. It is therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span> presumed that
the legislature will distinguish between the over-sanguine
hopes, in point of time, of an invention which, however,
has at length succeeded, and those visionary projects which
deceive for ever. Upon the whole, Mr. Champion humbly rests his
pretensions to the protection of the legislature upon three
grounds—that he has been almost from the beginning concerned
in the work which has cost so much labour and expense; that he
now allows the inventor a certain and increasing recompense,
though the carrying that invention to an actual merchantable
manufacture was entirely his own work; that the potteries
of chinaware in most other countries in Europe have been at
the charge of sovereign princes. It has been immediately so
in France, Austria, Dresden, and Brandenburgh; in Italy they
have been under the care of great noblemen. In this original
work Mr. Champion claims the principal share of supporting,
improving, and carrying into execution a manufacture so much
admired in China and Japan, and now first attempted in Britain,
in capacity of resisting the greatest heat, equal to the
Asiatic and Dresden.”</p>
</div>

<p>Wedgwood answered this “Reply” of Champion’s by some “Remarks,” which
he issued to the members of the legislature, wherein he reminds them
that he “has all his life been concerned in the manufacture and
improvement of various branches of pottery and porcelain; that he has
long had an ambition to carry these manufactures to the highest pitch
of perfection they will admit of; and that so far from having any
personal interest in opposing Mr. Champion, it would evidently have
been his interest to have accepted of some of the obliging proposals
that have been made to him by Mr. Champion and his friends, and to
have said nothing more upon the subject; but Mr. Wedgwood is so fully
convinced of the great injury that would be done to the landed,
manufacturing, and commercial interests of this nation, by extending
the term of Mr. Champion’s monopoly of raw materials, of which there
are immense quantities in the kingdom, and confining the use of them
to one or a few hands, that he thought it a duty of moral obligation
to take the sense of his neighbours upon this subject, and to give
up to the manufactory at large all advantages he might have secured
to himself. It is upon these principles, and these alone, that he
has acted in this business, and therefore he humbly presumes he does
not merit the censure of <i>avidity</i> in grasping at other men’s
manufactures, though he thinks that himself and all manufacturers
should be protected in the <i>free use</i> of all raw materials that
are not invented by men, but are the natural productions of the earth.
When Mr. Wedgwood discovered the art of making <i>Queen’s Ware</i>,
which employs ten times more people than all the china works in the
kingdom, he did not ask for a patent for this important discovery.
A patent would greatly have limited its public utility. Instead of
<i>one hundred manufactories</i> of Queen’s Ware, there would have
been <i>one</i>; and instead of an exportation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span> to all quarters of the
world, a few pretty things would have been made for the amusement of
the people of fashion in England. It would be the same with the use of
the materials in question: if they are not only confined to the use
of one person or manufactory, by patent, for fourteen years, but that
patent be extended for twenty or thirty years longer, so long they may
be the means of supporting <i>one</i> trifling manufactory; but if
the materials are left free for general use, and Mr. Champion is in
possession of the result of all his experiments and real discoveries
with respect to the art of manufacturing these raw materials into
porcelain, no essential part of which has been revealed by him to the
public, either in his specifications or otherwise, then there is reason
to expect a very large and extensive manufactory of porcelain will be
established in various parts of this kingdom, to the great benefit of
the public, without any injury to Mr. Champion.”</p>

<p>Wedgwood continued his “remarks” by replying that Mr. Champion’s offer
of inserting a clause to allow the potters the free use of the raw
material in all kinds of earthenware, restricting its use in porcelain
only to himself, was a useless concession, because Champion had failed
to define the difference between earthenware and porcelain, and had
failed to impart the secret of his manufacture to the public, either
by his specifications or otherwise. “How then,” he asked, “are the
Staffordshire potters to use the growan stone and growan clay for the
improvement of their finer stone and earthenwares, without producing
such a manufacture as may in Westminster Hall be deemed porcelain?” He
also said that, judging from Mr. Champion’s own words, Cookworthy’s
patent “ought not to have been applied for at so early a period,” it
was evident that the “patent was taken out for a discovery of the
art of making true porcelain before it <i>was</i> made; and if the
discovery has been since made, there can have been no specification of
it; it has not been revealed to the public, it is in Mr. Champion’s
own possession, and being <i>unknown</i>, it is presumed the right to
practise it cannot be confirmed or extended by Act of Parliament, which
ought to have some clear ground to go upon.” The patent, he says, has
evidently been considered as a privilege to the patentee, “for the sole
right of <i>making experiments</i> upon materials which many persons
have thought would make good porcelain, and on which experiments have
been prosecuted by several successive sets of operators many years
before the date<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span> of the patent.” He contended that it would have been
an “egregious injury to the public” to continue the patent to one
person who was no original discoverer, who was only just commencing
the commonest and most useful part of his business with the aid of a
foreign artificer, in the hope that a discovery might at some future
time be made. He considered that if the raw materials were thrown open
to all, “a variety of experienced hands would probably produce more
advantage to the nation in a few years than they would ever do when
confined to one manufactory, however skilful the director might be,”
and that the extension of the patent securing the monopoly “would be
a precedent of the most dangerous nature, contrary to policy, and of
general inconvenience,” and therefore he “humbly hopes the legislature
will not grant the prayer of Mr. Champion’s petition,”—a hope which,
however earnestly expressed, and however tenaciously followed, was
eventually of no avail. To this opposition, however, is doubtless to be
traced the ultimate abandonment of the patent, and the manufacture of
the less difficult soft paste to so great an extent in Staffordshire.</p>

<p>The term of the original patent, it will be remembered, was for
fourteen years, of which nearly eight years remained unexpired at the
time when it was assigned over by Cookworthy to Champion. The extension
petitioned for would thus have given Champion nearly twenty-two
years’ exclusive right to the raw materials, and it was this extended
monopoly which aroused the watchfulness of Wedgwood, and made him
determined to use his utmost efforts to prevent its being enacted.
In this opposition—which was determined and energetic, though only
partially successful—Wedgwood, besides memorialising the legislature
against granting the prayer of the petition, issued a number of
“Reasons why the extension of the term of Mr. Cookworthy’s patent, by
authority of parliament, would be injurious to many landowners, to the
manufacturers of earthenware, and to the public.” In addition to this,
he made out and presented a “Case of the manufacturers of earthenware
in Staffordshire,” setting forth the advantages that would be derived
from throwing open the use of the raw materials, and the disadvantages
which an extension of the monopoly would entail, not only on the
manufacturers, but on the public at large.</p>

<p>These “reasons” why the extension of the term of Mr. Cookworthy’s
patent, by authority of parliament, would be injurious to landowners,
to the manufacturers of earthenware, and to the public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span> are so
ingenious, and the “case” so carefully made out, that I here give them
entire.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It would be injurious to the <i>landowners</i>, because by
means of this monopoly materials of great value would be locked
up within the bowels of the earth, and the owners be deprived
of the power of disposing of them; for the present patentee and
his assigns have contracted with <i>one gentleman</i> that he
shall sell these materials only to <i>them</i>, and that they
shall purchase such materials only from <i>him</i>, during the
term of <i>ninety-nine</i> years.</p>

<p>“It would be injurious to the <i>manufacturers</i> of
earthenware; because, notwithstanding the mechanical part
of their manufactory, their execution, their forms, their
painting, &amp;c., are equal, if not superior, to those of any
other country, yet the <i>body</i> of their ware stands in
great need of improvement, both in colour and texture; because
the public begin to require and expect such improvement;
because without such improvement the sale of their manufactures
will probably decline in favour of foreign manufacturers, who
may not be deprived of the use of the materials that their
countries produce. For the consideration in this case is not
whether one manufacturer or manufactory shall be supported
against another, but whether the earthenware manufactories of
<i>Great Britain</i> shall be supported in their improvements
against those of every other country in the world; because the
materials in question are the most proper of any that have been
found in this island for the improvement of the manufactures
of earthenware; and because <i>no line has been drawn</i>, or
<i>can be drawn</i>, with sufficient distinctness, between
earthenware and porcelain, and especially between earthenware
and the various kinds of this patent porcelain, to render it
safe for any potter to make use of these materials in his works.</p>

<p>“The extension of this monopoly would be injurious to the
<i>public</i>, by preventing the employment of a great number
of vessels in the coasting trade in bringing the raw materials
from the places where they would be dug out of the earth to the
different parts of this island where they would be manufactured.</p>

<p>“This extension would also be injurious to the public because
it would prevent our manufacturers of earthenware from being
<i>improved in their quality</i> and <i>increased in their
quantity and value</i> to the amount of many hundred thousand
pounds <i>per annum</i>.</p>

<p>“And lastly, it would be injurious to the public by preventing
a very great increase of our exports, <i>which must infallibly
take place</i> when the body of our earthenwares shall come to
be improved so as to bear a proportion to the beauty of their
forms and the excellence of their workmanship.</p>

<p>“Upon the whole, would it not be unreasonable to extend the
term of a monopoly in favour of an individual to the prejudice
of ten thousand industrious manufacturers, when the individual
can have no merit with the public, as he has made no discovery
to them?”</p>
</div>

<p>The following is the “case” of the manufacturers of earthenware in
Staffordshire, as drawn up by Wedgwood:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The potters, and other persons depending upon the pottery in
<i>Staffordshire</i>, beg leave humbly to represent that Nature
has provided this island with immense quantities of materials
proper for the improvement of their manufactures; that such
materials have been known and used twenty or thirty years
ago, and that many experiments were made upon them by various
operators with various degrees of success.</p>

<p>“That porcelain was made of these materials, and publicly sold
before the year 1768.</p>

<p>“That in March, 1768, <i>Mr. Cookworthy</i>, of
<i>Plymouth</i>, took out a patent for the sole use of the
materials in question, called in the patent moor-stone or
growan, and growan clay, for the making of porcelain, which is
defined to have a fine colour and a lucid grain, and likewise
to be as infusible as the Asiatic.</p>

<p>“That <i>Mr. Cookworthy</i> contracted, as the condition upon
which he held the privilege of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span> monopoly, that he would
make a full and true specification of the art by which he
converted these materials into porcelain, and that he entirely
failed in fulfilling this obligation.</p>

<p>“For in the pretended specification which he made, he omitted
to describe the <i>principal operations</i> in which his art or
discovery consisted, having neither exhibited the proportions
in which the materials were to be mixed to produce the
<i>body</i> or the <i>glaze</i>, nor the art of <i>burning</i>
the <i>ware</i>, which he knew to be the <i>most difficult</i>
and important part of the discovery.</p>

<p>“That the company concerned in the porcelain manufactory at
<i>Plymouth</i>, established under the authority of this
patent, contracted with one gentleman, in whose lands these
materials are found, that he should sell the materials only to
them, and that they should purchase materials from no other
person, during the term of ninety-nine years.</p>

<p>“That nevertheless there are great quantities of such materials
in other estates in <i>Cornwall</i> and <i>Devonshire</i>, and
probably in many other parts of this island.</p>

<p>“That in the year 1774 <i>Mr. Cookworthy</i> assigned over his
patent right to <i>Mr. Champion</i>, of <i>Bristol</i>, who now
applies to parliament for an extension of this monopoly, seven
years before the expiration of the patent; which assignment was
made upon condition that <i>Mr. Cookworthy</i> should receive
for ninety-nine years from <i>Mr. Champion</i> as large a sum
every year as should be paid to the proprietor for the raw
materials, hereby laying a tax of 100 per cent. upon them.</p>

<p>“That <i>Mr. Champion</i> in his petition sets forth that he
has brought this discovery to perfection; and that in a paper
he has published, entitled <i>A Reply, &amp;c.</i>, he says that if
the various difficulties which have attended this work from the
beginning could have been foreseen, <i>this patent ought not
to have been applied for at so early a period</i>; that is, in
plain English, the patent was taken out for the discovery of an
art before the discovery was made by the patentee. And if the
discovery has been made since, there has been no specification
of it; it has not been recorded for the public benefit; it is
in <i>Mr. Champion’s</i> own possession; it is kept from the
public for his own private emolument: and the <i>nature</i> of
it being <i>unknown</i>, it is humbly presumed such a pretended
discovery can neither entitle the patentee nor the petitioner
to the extension of a monopoly injurious to many thousands of
industrious manufacturers in various parts of the kingdom.</p>

<p>“And in the same paper in which we find the above curious
confession, <i>Mr. Champion</i> acknowledges that even at
<i>this time</i> he has just entered upon the commonest and
most useful branch of his manufactory, which he has pursued at
a great expense, by means of a <i>foreign artificer</i>, and
can <i>now</i> venture to assert that he <i>shall</i> bring
it to perfection. And in the space of seven years yet to come
of his patent, and fourteen years’ further indulgence which
he expects from parliament, one would hope some discovery
might be made; but would it not be an egregious injury to the
public, an unheard of and unprecedented discouragement to
many manufacturers who have great and acknowledged merit with
the public, to continue to <i>one person</i> who, in <i>this
instance</i>, has no <i>public merit</i>, the monopoly of
earth and stones that nature has furnished this country with
in immense quantities, which are necessary to the support and
improvement of one of the most valuable manufactures in the
kingdom?</p>

<p>“<i>Mr. Champion</i> says, in the Reply referred to
above, he ‘has no objection to the use which the potters
of <i>Staffordshire</i> may make of his or any other raw
materials, provided earthenware only, as distinguished by
that title, is made from them. He wants to interfere with no
manufactory whatsoever, and is content to insert any clause to
<i>confine</i> him to the invention which he possesses, and
which he has improved,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>“If <i>Mr. Champion</i> had accurately defined the
<i>nature</i> of his own invention; if he had described the
proportions of his materials necessary to make the body of his
ware; if he had also specified the proportions of his materials
necessary to produce his glaze, as every mechanical inventor
who takes out a patent is obliged to specify the nature of the
machine by which he produces his effect; if <i>Mr. Champion</i>
could have drawn a <i>distinct line</i> between the <i>various
kinds of earthenware and porcelain</i> that have been made,
and are now made in this kingdom, and <i>his porcelain</i>,
a clause might have been formed to have confined him to the
invention which he says he possesses, and to have prevented
him from <i>interrupting the progress of</i> other <i>men’s
improvements</i>, which he may think proper to call imitations
of his porcelain; but as he has not chosen to do the former,
nor been able to do the latter, no manufacturer of stoneware,
Queen’s ware, or porcelain, can with safety improve the present
state of his manufacture.</p>

<p>“It is well known that manufactures of this kind can only
support their credit by continual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span> improvements. It is also
well known that there is a <i>competition</i> in these
improvements through all <i>parts of Europe</i>. In the
last century <i>Burslem</i>, and some other villages in
<i>Staffordshire</i>, were famous for making <i>milk pans</i>
and <i>butter pots</i>, and by a succession of improvements,
the manufactory in that neighbourhood has gradually increased
in the variety, the quality, and the quantity of its
productions, so as to furnish, besides the home consumption,
an annual export of useful and ornamental wares, nearly to
the amount of <i>two hundred thousand</i> pounds; but during
all this progress it has had the free range of the country
for materials to work upon, to the great advantage of many
landowners and of navigation.</p>

<p>“<i>Queen’s</i> ware has already several of the properties
of porcelain, but is yet capable of receiving many essential
improvements. The public have for some time <i>required</i>
and expected them. Innumerable experiments have been made for
this purpose. There are immense quantities of materials in
the kingdom that would answer this end; but they are locked
up by a monopoly in the bowels of the earth, useless to the
<i>landowners</i>, useless to the <i>manufacturers</i>, useless
to the public; and one person is petitioning the legislature,
in effect, to stop all the improvements in earthenware and
porcelain in this kingdom but his own.</p>

<p>“For the next step, and the only step the manufacturers can
take to improve their wares, will be deemed an invasion of this
<i>vague</i> and <i>incomprehensible</i> patent.</p>

<p>“The manufacturers of earthenware are justly alarmed at the
prospect of extending the term of the patent, because, without
improvements, the sale of their manufactures <i>must certainly
decline</i> in favour of <i>foreign manufacturers</i>, who
may not be deprived of the <i>free use of the materials their
countries produce</i>; for the consideration in this case is
not whether one manufacturer or manufactory shall be supported
against another, but whether the earthenware and porcelain
manufactories of <i>Great Britain</i> shall be supported in
their improvements against those of every other country in
the world. Upon the whole, the petitioners against the bill
humbly presume this monopoly will appear to be <i>contrary
to good policy</i>, highly <i>injurious</i> to the public,
and <i>generally inconvenient</i>; that the extension of the
monopoly, supposing any patent to be valid, would be greater
<i>increasing the injury</i>; that the bill now depending is
not only calculated to <i>extend</i>, but to <i>confirm</i> it,
and therefore they humbly hope it will not be suffered to pass
into a law.”</p>
</div>

<p>Despite all this factious opposition—for it was factious in the
extreme—to his petition by Wedgwood, as the representative of the
potters, and by the members of parliament for the county of Stafford,
and others who had been moved by the exertions of Wedgwood and his
friends, the bill passed the House of Commons, and was sent up to the
lords without amendment. The “case” just given, along with extracts
from the bill, with comments, showing, among other things, that the
passing of the Act, as originally framed, conferred the full benefits
of Cookworthy’s patent on Champion, without compelling him to enrol
anew any specification of his process of manufacture, was printed for
circulation among the members of the Upper House. With reference to
this important point, it was shown that Cookworthy, having enrolled
his specification, and having afterwards assigned the patent right to
Champion, the bill enacted that all and every the powers, liberties,
privileges, authorities, and advantages which in and by the said
letters patent were originally granted to the said William Cookworthy,
shall be held, exercised, and enjoyed by the said Richard Champion
for the present term of fourteen years, granted by the said letters
patent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span> and after the expiration thereof, for the further term of
fourteen years, in as full, ample, and beneficial a manner as the
said Richard Champion could have held the same in case the said
letters patent had originally been granted to him. The view of the
bill is manifestly to confirm to Mr. Champion the letters patent for
the present term of fourteen years, as well as to grant him fourteen
years more. Had it been intended only to <i>enlarge</i> the term,
and that the letters patent should have stood upon their own ground,
such words of confirmation would not have been necessary; or if they
had been thought so, they should have been succeeded by words to the
effect following:—“<i>Subject, nevertheless, to the same provisoes,
conditions, limitations, and agreements, as the said William Cookworthy
held and enjoyed the same before the date of the said assignment.</i>”
But these being omitted, and the bill having stated that the “said
William Cookworthy had described the nature of his said invention
and the manner in which the same is to be performed,” it is evident
that the design of the bill is not only to confirm absolutely the
letters patent, and consequently the monopoly of these materials for
the present term of fourteen years, but also to grant it to him for
fourteen years more; and the Act is to have this operation, even
though the letters patent may be void by the discovery not being a new
invention, according to the statute of James I., or by Mr. Cookworthy’s
not having conformed to the terms and conditions of the letters patent,
by having described and ascertained the nature of the said invention,
and the manner in which the same is to be performed. That the making of
porcelain is not a new invention is too evident to need any proof; that
the letters patent are not within the intent of the statute is manifest
by a cursory perusal of it. That Mr. Cookworthy has not described
and ascertained the nature of this invention and the manner in which
the same is to be performed (unless the discovery of the materials
can alone be deemed so), will appear by what he has been pleased to
call his specification. But it will appear in evidence that even the
discovery of the materials was not, at the time of granting the letters
patent to Mr. Cookworthy, “new and his own,” but that they were at that
time, and had been long before, applied to the uses of pottery.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Is it therefore reasonable that Parliament should confirm to
Mr. Champion the present term of fourteen years, and also grant
him fourteen years more, in the monopoly of an immense quantity
of materials, the natural products of the earth, for the making
of porcelain, which no person is to <i>imitate or resemble</i>;
but also virtually the sole privilege of vending and disposing
of these materials at what price and in what manner he thinks
proper? For no person can use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span> them in any respect but they
will produce (if not the same effect) an effect that will
<i>resemble</i> what he may call his patent porcelain; and it
is not to conceive how he can be deprived of the exclusive
right of selling as well as using these materials if the bill
now depending should pass into a law.”</p>
</div>

<p>The presenting these papers to the Lords produced more effect, it would
seem, than the efforts in a similar direction had apparently done in
the Commons. The consequence was, that “Lord Gower and some other noble
lords, having fully informed themselves of the facts upon which the
merits of the case depended, and having considered the subject with a
degree of attention proportioned to its importance, saw clearly the
injurious nature of the bill, and were determined to oppose it.” This
determination brought on a conference between the two noble lords who
took the most active part for and against the bill, and the result was
the introduction of two clauses, the first making it imperative on
Champion to enrol anew his specification of both body and glaze within
the usual period of four months; the second throwing open the use of
the raw materials to potters for any purpose except the manufacture of
porcelain, was as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Provided, also, that nothing in this Act contained shall
be construed to hinder or prevent any potter or potters, or
any other person or persons, from making use of any such
raw materials, or any mixture or mixtures thereof (except
such mixture of raw materials, and in such proportions, as
are described in the specification hereinbefore directed
to be enrolled), anything in this Act to the contrary
notwithstanding.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Act being obtained (specimens of his skill in making porcelain
having been submitted to the Committee by Champion), the specification
was duly prepared and enrolled according to the provisions of the Act.
It is dated the 12th of September, 1775, and was duly enrolled on the
15th of the same month. The following is the specification, which will
be found to contain much matter of interest; and, taken in conjunction
with that of Cookworthy, given in my account of the Plymouth works,
completes the important series of papers in connection with this
manufactory:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">To all to whom these presents shall come, I, Richard
Champion</span>, of Bristol, Merchant, send greeting, and so
forth.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Whereas</span> his present Majesty, King George the
Third, in the eighth year of his reign, did grant his Royal
Letters Patent to William Cookworthy, of Plymouth, chymist,
for the sole use and exercise of ‘<span class="smcap">A Discovery of Certain
Materials for Making of Porcelain</span>,’ which Letters Patent
have been duly assigned to me the said Richard Champion; and
whereas by a certain Act of Parliament (intitled an Act for

Bristol, Merchant—to whom the said Letters Patent have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
assigned—to carry the said Discovery into execution for the
Benefit of the Public), all and every the powers, liberties,

the said William Cookworthy are granted to me, the said Richard
Champion, my executors, administrators, and assigns, during
the remainder of the term of the said Letters Patent, and from

provided I, the said Richard Champion, should cause to be
inrolled in the High Court of Chancery, within four months
after passing the said Act, a specification of the mixture
of the raw materials of which my porcelain is composed, and
likewise of the mixture and proportions of the raw materials
which compose the glaze of the same, which specification was in
the hands of the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Now know ye therefore</span>, that I, the said Richard
Champion, do hereby testify and declare that the specification
hereinafter contained is the true and just specification of
the mixture and proportions of the raw materials of which
my porcelain is composed, and likewise of the mixture and
proportions of the raw materials which compose the glaze of the
same, and which, at the time of passing the before-mentioned
Act, was in the hands of the Lord High Chancellor of Great
Britain (that is to say):—</p>

<p>“The raw materials of the above porcelain are plastic clay,
generally found mixed with mica and a coarse gravelly matter.
It is known in the counties of Devon and Cornwall by the name
of growan clay. The other raw material is a mixed micarious
earth or stone called in the aforesaid countries moor-stone
and growan. The gravel found in the growan clay is of the same
nature, and is used for the same purpose in making the body of
my porcelain as the moor-stone and growan. The mixture of these
materials to make the body of the porcelain is according to
the common potter’s method, and has no peculiar art in it. The
proportions are as follow:—The largest proportion of the stone
or gravel aforesaid to the clay aforesaid is four parts of
stone to one of clay. The largest proportion of clay to stone
is sixteen parts of clay to one part of stone mixed together.
I use these and every proportion intermediate, between the
foregoing proportions of the stone to the clay and the clay to
the stone, and all this variation I make without taking away
from the ware the distinguishing appearance and properties of
Dresden and Oriental porcelains, which is the appearance and
are the properties of mine. The raw materials of which the
glaze is composed are, the stone or gravel aforesaid, and the
clay aforesaid, magnesia, nitre, lime, gypsum, fusible spar,
arsenic, lead, and tin ashes.</p>

<p>“The proportions of our common glaze are as follows, together
with every intermediate proportion, videlicet:—</p>

<p>“I have described truly and justly the raw materials, the

from all other wares which are vulgarly called earthen or stone
wares, which can sustain an equal degree of heat, by the grain,
the colour of the grain, and by its semi-transparency; whereas
the earthenwares, such as Staffordshire white and yellow
earthenwares and all other earthenwares which sustain a strong
heat without being fused, are found, when subjected to the most
intense heat, to appear cellular or otherwise, easily by the
eye to be distinguished from the true porcelain.</p>

</div>

<p>The works of Richard Champion were in Castle Green, Bristol, and I was
enabled, in 1863, assisted by the researches of Mr. Edkins, kindly
undertaken at my request, to fix the exact locality both of the works
and of Champion’s residence. This he determined by the singularly
fortuitous circumstance of a Directory for the city of Bristol having
been published—and for that one year only—in the year in which
Champion obtained his Act of Parliament, 1775. In this Directory, which
is of extreme rarity, occurs the following entry:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Champion, Richard, <i>China Manufactory</i>, 15, and his
house, 17, Castle Green.”</p>
</div>

<p>This occurs in the alphabetical list of “Merchants, Tradesmen,
&amp;c.,” and in another list of the “Merchants and Bankers and their
residences,” is the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Champion, Richard, 17, Castle Green.”</p>
</div>

<p>It is perhaps worth just mentioning that this Directory, so opportunely
made, is an admirable illustration of the difficulties under which
compilers of those useful publications had to labour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span> in the olden
times. It was compiled by a person of the name of Sketchley, and, most
of the houses not being in those days numbered, he carried with him a
lot of metal figures, and nailed them on to the doors as he went on,
charging a shilling at each house for doing so; and it is related of
him that, with a strict eye to business, he excluded the names of some
persons from his list who refused to pay the impost! Fortunately for
my purpose, Richard Champion had evidently paid a couple of shillings,
and so ensured not only his residence at No. 17, but his works at No.
15 being duly entered. The site of the china works is now covered with
small houses.</p>

<p>Armed with his new Act of Parliament, by which he was empowered to
enjoy nearly twenty-two years’ patent right, Champion spared no
pains and no expense to make the productions of his works as good as
possible; and that he continued to produce a magnificent body and a
remarkably fine glaze, and turned out some truly exquisite specimens of
fictile art, both in design, in potting, in modelling, and in painting,
is fully evident by examples still remaining in the hands of collectors.</p>

<p>The commoner description of goods, the blue and white ware, seems to
have been, very naturally, considered by Champion to be the branch most
likely to pay him, commercially, and this he at one time cultivated
to a greater extent than any other branch. His acknowledged and
advertised model was the Dresden, and his best efforts were turned in
this direction. The patterns which he adopted, being, naturally, in
many cases almost identical with those produced at Worcester and other
places—which, of course, arose from the fact of the different works
copying from the same models—the ware made by Champion is sometimes
apt to be appropriated by collectors to that manufactory. It may,
however, easily be distinguished by those who are conversant with the
peculiarities of its make.</p>

<p>In blue and white, Champion produced dinner, tea, and coffee services,
toilet pieces, jugs, mugs, and all the varieties of goods usually made
at that period. The blue is usually of good colour, and the painting
quite equal to that of other manufactories. Some of these pieces are
embossed, and of really excellent workmanship. A good deal of the blue
and white ware was marked with the usual cross, but it appears more
than probable that the greatest part of this kind of goods passed out
of the works unmarked.</p>

<p>Another characteristic class of goods made by Champion was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span> the
imitation of the most common Chinese patterns, examples of which are
shown in the next engraving of a saucer and a teapot.</p>

<p>There is a thorough Chinese style in the decoration of these pieces,
and the colouring is also remarkably well reproduced. The saucer bears
the usual mark of the cross, but very many examples of this class which
have come under my notice are not marked at all, and pass as foreign
pieces. In the same group I have given a cup of elegant form, but of
different style, to show the beauty of its outline. Transfer printing
was not, it would appear, practised by Champion, but some examples,
Mr. Owen informs me, are known, which, although made at Bristol, were
evidently printed at Worcester.</p>

  </div>

<p>The expenses attendant on this unwarrantable opposition in Parliament
drained Champion’s exchequer, and despite the energy of himself, the
skill of his workmen, and the beauty of the ware produced at his
manufactory, Richard Champion’s hopes of permanently establishing an
art in Bristol, which should not only be an honourable and useful, but
a remunerative one, proved fallacious, and in little more than five
years from his obtaining of the Act of Parliament, the works which he
had laboured so hard to establish, and on which he had expended so much
time, money, and skill, were lost to the city of Bristol, and removed
for ever from its walls, but not, fortunately, until he had proved
incontestably his ability to produce a genuine porcelain of the finest
texture, and of the most artistic and finished style.</p>

<p>In 1775 Champion advertised his works as “Patent China, at the
Manufactory in Castle Green.” In 1776 he advertised it thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Established by Act of Parliament, The Bristol China
Manufactory in Castle Green. This China is greatly superior to
every other English Manufactory (<i>sic</i>). Its texture is
fine, exceeding the East India and its strength so great that
water may be boiled in it. It is a true Porcelain composed
of a native clay and is thus distinguished from every other
English China which being composed of a Number of Ingredients
mix’d together the principal part being Glass occasions it
soon to get dirty in the wear renders it continually liable to
Accidents and in every respect only an Imitation and therefore
stiled by Chemists, a false Porcelain.”</p>

  </div>

<p>In 1778, Josiah Wedgwood, in a letter, dated August 24th in that
year, says, “Poor Champion, you may have heard is quite demolished;
it was never likely to be otherwise, as he had neither professional
knowledge, sufficient capital, nor scarcely any real acquaintance
with the materials he was working upon. I suppose we might buy some
<i>growan stone</i> and <i>growan clay</i> now upon easy terms, for
they have prepared a large quantity this last year.” This curious
letter, whose sympathy was certainly left-handed, did but little credit
to Wedgwood—the man who of all others had worked hard to crush him,
and had succeeded in so doing. His hope now that Champion was “quite
demolished” was that he might be able to gain his point and get the
growan stone and clay on easy terms! It is lamentable to feel that
a great name could sink so low. It does not appear, however, that
Champion ever became bankrupt, or even appealed to his creditors.</p>

  </div>

<p>In his Bristol works, although only his own name appears in the various
documents to which I have alluded, Champion had friends who assisted
pecuniarily in his undertaking. One of these friends was Joseph Fry,
the grandfather of the present Mr. Francis Fry, F.S.A., of Bristol,
whose name is as well known among biblists and connoisseurs in china
for his fine collection of old bibles and choice porcelain as the firm
to which he belongs is to the general public for the “Fry’s Chocolate”
which they manufacture to so large an extent. Mr. Joseph Fry, the
friend of Champion, died in 1786, about nine years after the works had
been closed on their removal into Staffordshire; and it appears that
the only return he got for the capital he had sunk in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span> concern, was
the beautiful set of vases now in the possession of his grandson.</p>

<p>The patent right was sold by Champion, in 1781—not 1777, as stated
by Shaw—to a company of Staffordshire potters, who continued the
manufacture at New Hall (which see for a continuation of this
narrative) for some time, when the ordinary soft-paste china was
allowed to supersede it. Thus the works at Bristol were brought to
a close, and the manufacture of porcelain was lost to the locality.
Champion himself with his family removed for a time into Staffordshire,
fixing themselves at Newcastle-under-Lyne, in November, 1781, and
there remained until April, 1782, when, having been appointed a Deputy
Paymaster-General of the Forces, by Edmund Burke, he left Staffordshire
“at a day’s notice,” and removed to London, having apartments at
Chelsea Hospital. This appointment he only held till 1784. In October
of that year he sailed for Charleston, in South Carolina, and there he
died, in 1791.</p>

<p>Bristol china (marked), every description of which, owing to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
short time the works were in operation, and other causes, is scarce,
is particularly rare in the finer and more highly finished varieties.
Fortunately, however, examples of these different varieties, of the
very finest kind, are still preserved, and attest most strongly to
the extreme perfection to which Champion succeeded in bringing his
works. Much discrimination is, nevertheless, required in appropriating
examples, and it is well to caution collectors against placing too much
reliance on the sweeping way in which, by some writers, all examples
are hauled into the Bristol net; and by others into those of Lowestoft
and other places.</p>

  </div>

<p>One of the choicest examples of the highest class of art in Bristol
porcelain existing at the present day, is the tea-service of which
the cup and saucer engraved on Fig. <a href="#image382">749</a> forms a part. This splendid
service, of which, through the courtesy of Miss Smith, this cup and
saucer passed into my hands, possesses a double interest, first from
its being made “the best that the manufactory could produce;” and,
second, from the historical associations which are connected with
it. This example is also highly important as showing the perfection
to which the manufacture of porcelain had been brought by Champion
in 1774–5. It seems that in 1774 Edmund Burke, while the contested
election for Bristol was going on, remained in that city, and for a
month was the guest of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, who were his warm friends
and zealous supporters, and he presented this splendid set of china,
made expressly, by his own order, by Mr. Champion, to Mrs. Smith, and
the remains of the set are now the property of that lady’s daughter,
Miss Smith, of Berkeley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span> Crescent. This set, it is fair to presume,
was ordered by Burke while remaining in Bristol, or at all events
about that time, which would be the very year in which the transfer of
the Plymouth works to Champion of Bristol was completed. As a service
of such exquisite beauty and such minute detail in painting would
necessarily be a work of time, the absolute date of its completion
may be set down to the beginning of the year 1775. The decorations
of Burke’s service are of chaste and elaborate design and delicate
workmanship. It is profusely and massively gilt in both dead and
burnished gold, the wreaths of laurel, &amp;c., being in green, which was
Burke’s electioneering colour. Each piece bears the monogram of Mrs.
Smith, S S conjoined, formed of wreaths of roses in pink and gold, and
also the arms of Smith, <i>sable</i>, a fesse between three saltiers
<i>or</i>; on an escutcheon of pretence the arms of Pope, <i>or</i>,
two chevronels and a canton <i>gules</i>, the latter charged with a
mullet of the first; and the crest of Smith, a saltier <i>or</i>.
The pieces of this service are marked with the usual cross. In the
Museum of Practical Geology is a cup and saucer of the same form,
presented by the Duchess of Northumberland, in which the festoons and
borders are of similar character, but of very inferior workmanship to
those just described. Another remarkably fine and, of course, unique
service was brought under the hammer in 1871, and deserves more than a
passing notice. This service had been made by Champion and presented
by him and his wife to Mrs. Burke. On the larger pieces were the
arms of Burke impaling Nugent on a pedestal, supported, dexter, by a
figure of Liberty; and, sinister, by a figure of Plenty. On the top
of the pedestal is Cupid with a flaming torch, and at the base the
inscription, “<span class="allsmcap">I. BVRKE, OPT. B. M. R. ET. I. CHAMPION. D. D.D.
PIGNVS. AMICITÆ. III. NON. NOV. MDCCLXXIV.</span>” Other decorations also
are introduced. Portions of this service (which it is a pity was ever
dispersed) are in possession of Mr. Callender, of Mr. Edkins, of Mr.
Fry, and others. I am indebted to Mr. Owen for permission to reproduce
from his admirable volume the engraving of a portion of this service
(Fig. <a href="#image384">750</a>), and for the use of several other woodcuts.</p>

  </div>

<p>Amongst the finest known productions of the Bristol works are the
series of splendid vases in the possession of Mr. Francis Fry, F.S.A.,
to which I alluded in my account of Plymouth china. One of these is
engraved on Fig. <a href="#image386">754</a>; it is 12¼ inches in height, and of hexangular
form. The landscapes are exquisitely painted, and it has well modelled
female busts on two of its sides, from which hang<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span> festoons of
raised coloured flowers. The other vases in Mr. Fry’s possession, one
of which has a perforated neck, though differing in form, style, and
ornamentation, exhibit the same excellence and skill in workmanship
and in decoration which are so remarkable on this specimen. That these
vases were painted by the same artists as the highest class of Plymouth
china is very apparent to those who are conversant with their works.
The birds are clearly “of the same family,” and the general style of
decoration bears evident mark of coming from the same hands. They are
<i>not marked</i>, and therefore a doubt very naturally arises as to
whether they were made before the works were removed from Plymouth,
and so brought as part of the “stock” to Bristol, or whether they were
really made after their establishment in that city. They are, however,
of a finer and higher quality than the marked Plymouth example, and
therefore there can be no reasonable doubt that they are Champion’s
production. Vases are distinctly spoken of in the evidence of John
Britain before the House of Commons in 1774. He said “that he has great
experience in several China manufactories, and has made several Trials
upon all those which had been manufactured in <i>England</i>, and finds
that all of them, except that of <i>Bristol</i>, were destroyed in
the same Fire that brings the Bristol to Perfection. And he produced
to your Committee several Samples of the said kinds of China, which
shewed the effects upon china severally; and said, that they have not
been able to bring the <i>Bristol</i> China to a marketable commodity,
so as to furnish an Order, until within the last Six Months, but that
sometimes they succeeded, and at other Times not, but that now they can
execute any order. That they have lately made considerable improvements
in the said Manufacture, and particularly are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span> endeavouring to perfect
the Blue, in which they have not as yet entirely succeeded, though
they have now a Gentleman who has succeeded in a small Way, in which
they have been at a considerable Expense; that the witness thinks the
Manufacture is capable of further improvements; that they can afford
it at a price equal to Foreign China of equal Goodness, and that they
have made some Specimens equal to good <i>Dresden</i>; that he has not
seen any <i>Dresden</i> ornamental China equal to the Vases produced to
your Committee, nor any Thing in Biscuit equal to the Biscuit in those
Vases, and other Ornaments; that the Gilding stands well; that the Seve
China differs from this; the Ornamental is more of a Cream colour, but
the Glaze is so soft that it will not bear using; that he believed the
enamel of the <i>Bristol</i> China is as hard as the <i>Dresden</i>,
and harder than the Chinese,” &amp;c. Mr. Champion also spoke very markedly
upon this improvement when he wrote these words; “Mr. Champion can
assert, with truth, that his hazard and expense were many times greater
than those of the original inventor. Mr. Champion mentions this without
the least disparagement to the worthy gentleman, Mr. Cookworthy, who
is his particular friend; he gives him all the merit which is due to
so great a discovery; he deserves it for finding out the means of a
manufacture, which will, in all probability, be a very great advantage
to this country; but yet Mr. Champion claims the merit of supporting
the work, and, when the inventor declined the undertaking himself,
with his time, his labour, and his fortune, improved it from a very
imperfect to an almost perfect manufacture; and he hopes, soon, with
proper encouragement, to one altogether perfect.”</p>

<p>The vases under notice fell to the lot of Mr. Fry’s grandfather at
the time of the close of the works, and have never been out of the
possession of the family. They are therefore attested as coming from
Champion’s establishment. In Mr. Fry’s possession is also a remarkably
interesting “waster” vase of the same general form and character, which
has apparently been spoiled by smoke in the kiln. This vase, I believe,
was purchased by its present possessor from a family in Bristol, in
whose possession it was stated to have been for seventy years. Other
vases of equal merit, all said to be Bristol, are in the possession of
Mr. Edkins, Mr. Nightingale, and Mr. Walker. Of services, and portions
of services, many fine examples exist in various private as well as in
the national collections. Many of these are of extreme beauty in design
and of remarkably good workmanship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span></p>

<p>Of these marvels of ceramic beauty Mr. Owen thus speaks:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Some of these are painted with exotic birds of brilliant
colour and landscape backgrounds, delicately panelled. The
design of others exhibits considerable ingenuity. One painted
with Chinese figures in medallions has a pencilled ground
selected with good taste from a natural object—shagreen, or
dressed shark-skin—often chosen by the Chinese for a similar
purpose; the hexagonal pattern of which has been felicitously
used as a ground with singular success. There is such a
similarity in the colour and handling when compared with
similar pieces of ware bearing the Plymouth mark, that some of
them must have been from the same pencil. One of these vases is
of special character, with perforated neck. It is hexagonal,
with landscapes exquisitely painted in monochrome,—two in
lake, two in blue, and two in green on several sides with good
effect. Besides these, Mr. Fry has another series that cannot
be doubted are <span class="smcap">Champion’s</span>, although they want the same
undeniable evidence of having passed directly from the factory
into the possession of his family. We engrave one of them
that has a cover, Fig. <a href="#image385c">751</a>; it is so artistically identical
in paste and glaze, touch and colour, with those preserved
by <i>Mr. Joseph Fry</i> as to need no other voucher for its
paternity. The same opinion may be given of a fine vase, Fig.
<a href="#image385c">752</a>, the property of Mr. J. E. Nightingale, The Mount, Wilton,
with a strong additional argument in support of it—one side
bears the same design enamelled in blue—the draw-well—that
is painted on Mr. Fry’s vase, Fig. <a href="#image386">754</a>. Mr. Edkins also has a
Bristol vase, similar to some in Mr. Fry’s collection, though
somewhat different in decoration. It is identical in form with
Fig. <a href="#image385c">752</a>, but without the modelled sprays and leaves. Four of
the sides are painted with landscapes in colour, two others in
blue monochrome, all exquisitely pencilled. The gilded border
round the upper portion beneath the neck is a rich arabesque
of elegant design. This is a charming example, in perfect
condition. The vase engraved (Fig. <a href="#image385c">753</a>), is one of a pair,
exquisitely decorated with birds and insects in panels on a
blue salmon-scale ground. They are similar in character to Mr.
Fry’s example, with a shagreen ground, already described. Some
former proprietor has had them mounted in ormolu. The design
of the metal work is rich and graceful, and in perfect harmony
with the gilded arabesque borders, framing with panels. The
height of all these vases is about twelve inches, and, with
cover, sixteen inches.”</p>

<p>Another notable and beautiful feature of the Bristol works was the
production of plaques, bouquets of flowers, wreaths, and armorial
bearings, in biscuit. Of these examples are given in Figs. <a href="#image389a2">755 to 758</a>.
One of these (Fig. <a href="#image389b2">757</a>), lately in the possession of Mr.
Baller, but now of Mr. Nightingale, bears the arms and crest of the
Eltons (who were connected with Bristol for the last two centuries
as bankers, members of parliament, and mayors, and of which the
present representative is Sir Arthur Hallam Elton, Bart.) impaling
Tierney. The arms are paly of six, <i>or</i> and <i>gules</i>, on a
bend <i>sable</i>, three mullets of the first, for Elton; impaling
<i>azure</i>, between two lions combatant a sword <i>argent</i>, for
Tierney. The shield is surrounded by a wreath of exquisitely and
delicately modelled leaves and flowers. The plaque is oval, 5¼ inches
in height by 4¼ inches in breadth. Another heraldic plaque is in the
possession of Miss Smith, of Bristol. It is of about the same size as
the one just described, and bears the arms of Smith, with escutcheon of
Pope, as described as appearing on the tea-service engraved (Fig. <a href="#image382">749</a>).
It is surrounded with a wreath of raised flowers of surpassing beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span></p>

<p>This interesting and valuable piece was some years ago stolen from
the late Mr. Smith, but, after about thirty years, was purchased by
its former owner at a sale along with some other examples of Bristol
make. In the possession of the late Mr. Edwin James, of Bristol, and
in other hands, are circular and oval plaques with wreaths or bouquets
of raised flowers, modelled in the same delicate and masterly manner,
and undoubtedly by the same artist. Another (Fig. <a href="#image389a2">755</a>), in Mr. Fry’s
collection, has the arms of France beautifully surrounded by a crowned
wreath of elaborately modelled flowers—the crown, wreath, and border
of which are of dead and burnished gold. Fig. <a href="#image389a2">756</a>, also in Mr. Fry’s
possession, is an exquisite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span> heraldic plaque, having the arms of
Harford impaling Lloyd, surrounded by a finely modelled wreath of
flowers. In the Edkins collection was also a plaque with a delicate
border of flowers enclosing a medallion profile of Franklin; and
another, a simple group of flowers, and other examples, belong to Mr.
Owen, Mr. Rawlins, Mr. Gwyn, and others. In her Majesty’s possession
are two remarkably fine examples with medallion profiles of George
III. and Queen Charlotte, presented to that queen by Champion himself
in 1775, together with a pair of smaller flower plaques of exquisite
finish and delicacy.</p>

<p>Figures were, to some extent, as is shown by the advertisements already
quoted, made at Bristol, and in Mr. James’s possession were a pair—a
man with a bird, and a woman with a barrel and a pig—bearing an
incised cross on the bottom. Other figures are in the possession of Mr.
Fry, Mr. Edkins, Lady Charlotte Schreiber, Mr. Castle, and others. (See
Figs. <a href="#image391">759 to 770</a>).</p>

<p>Mr. Owen gives in his admirable work a fac-simile of a letter, in
Champion’s own handwriting, addressed to the same modeller (whose name
unfortunately does not appear) who produced the “Four Elements” for the
Derby works, ordering from him a set of the same subjects, and also
the “Four Seasons,” treated in a way which he fully describes. The
letter is so interesting, and bears so strongly on the point of figure
producing at Bristol, that I here reprint it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="r2">27 Feb. 1772.</p>

<p class="p-min">“To</p>

<p>“M<sup>r</sup>. Brillait shew’d me your Letter of y<sub>e</sub> 18 Ins, which I
chose to answer myself as a few thoughts had struck me which
pleas’d me, &amp; which will with your Execution have a very good
Effect.</p>

<p>“As I have an Inclination to fancys of this kind, I chose to
write you as wish to have some elegant Designs. I have seen the
four Elements which are made at Derby they are very Beautifull
the dress easy, the forms fine, two in particular Air and Water
are the charming figures. I apprehend that you made y<sup>e</sup> models
&amp; therefore hope that from your Execution the following fancies
will not look amiss.</p>


<p class="center p1">“The Elements</p>

<p>“Fire. A Vulcan forging a Thunderbolt in the attitude of
striking with his anvil &amp; Hammer, some pieces of Iron or coals
or anything peculiar to a Blackmith’s Shop to be scatter’d
about.</p>

<p>“Water. A Naiad crown’d with rushes, leaning with her arm on an
urn from whence gushes out Water. In the other hand she holds a
fishing Net, with Fishes enclos’d in it, the ground ornamented
with rushes, shells, Fish or the Fancies peculiar to Water.</p>

<p>“Earth. An Husbandman digging with a spade a Baskett fill’d
with Implements of Husbandry on y<sup>e</sup> Ground. The ground
ornamented, with corn, acorns or Fruits.</p>

<p>“Air. A Winged Zephyr crown’d with Flowr’s treding on clouds,
which rise naturally about him, his robes flowing &amp; flying
behind him he holds in one Hand a Branch of a Tree, if any
ornaments behind are wanting, some Cherubim’s heads blowing
would not be amiss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span></p>


<p class="center p1">“The Seasons</p>

<p>“Spring. A Nymph with a Coronet of Flow’rs on her head in
Flowing Robes rather flying behind her, approaching with a
smiling countenance as she advances the flow’rs appear to start
up before her those at her feet higher those at a distance,
which seems to be just Budding out, on the side after a Plough
or Harrow, which she points to with one Hand, and with the
other holds a small open Baskett fill’d with Seeds which she
offers, from the Baskett falls a kind of Zone or Belt, on which
are represented, the sign of the Zodiac Aries Taurus Germinæ.</p>

<p>“Summer. A man in the Prime of Life, loosely dress’d with a
Bakt round his Body, on which are represented the Signs of the
Zodiac Cancer Leo Virgo APs a shear (made use of in shearing
Sheep) in one hand, and with the other Supports a Baskett of
wool on his shoulders—on the Ground a scythe with Trusses of
Hay schatter’d about.</p>

<p>“Autumn. A Matron with a kind of Coronet on her head, from
whence spring Ears of Corn. Her robes not so flow as spring
being of a graver Cast, in one Hand a Sickle, she leans on a
Thyrsis round which are twin’d Baskett of grapes,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> &amp; a Zone
or Belt falling from it, on which are represented the three
signs of y<sup>e</sup> Zodiac, Libra, Scorpia, Sagittarius, the grounds
she treads on full of Corn, &amp; on a side of her a Baskett of
fruit overturn’d.</p>

<p>“Winter. A Descriped old man his head bald and a Long Beard
leaning a Staff under one arm a Bundle of Sticks, his robe
schatter’d and clasp’d with a Belt, on which are represented
The three signs of the Zodiac, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces,
the ground cover’d with bare branches of Trees, Frost &amp; Snow &amp;
icicles hanging down in different Places.</p>

<p>“All these figures to be about 10 Inches high. After having
seen the Derby Figures I did not recommend Ease &amp; Elegance in
the Shape &amp; dress, but the latter I shall just mention as the
antique Robes, are very easy and have a Propriety which is
not to be met with in foreign Dresses, &amp; as these figures are
of a serious cast I think such dresses will carry woth them
a greater Elegance, I shall be oblig’d to you to carry the
designs into Execution as soon as possible, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>These series were accordingly executed, and all bear, in the examples
now remaining, the mark T o[sideways ‘o’ symbol];. It would thus
appear to be the modeller’s own mark, or contraction of his name.</p>

<p>The most authentic and interesting figure is a memorial to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span> Richard
Champion’s daughter Eliza, who died Oct. 13, 1779, aged fourteen.
The figure is a monumental statuette of a mourning female figure,
leaning on an urn, holding in her right hand a votive wreath and her
left closed on the drapery. The urn and pedestal bear a long and very
touching inscription. This interesting relic stands thirteen inches in
height; it is in the possession of Mr. J. M. Desaussure, of Camden,
South Carolina, who married a granddaughter of Champion. It is engraved
on Fig. <a href="#image391">759</a>, through the courtesy of Mr. Owen. Two admirable figures
(Figs. <a href="#image394b1">768</a> and <a href="#image394b2">769</a>) of a shepherd and milkmaid, marked with the T<sup>o</sup>
marks, are in the possession of Mr. Francis Fry, and a set of the
four seasons in rustic juvenile figures, bearing the same mark, were
in the Edkins collection (Figs. <a href="#image392a">760 to 763</a>). Another fine group is
“Love subdued by Time,” in the Edkins collection (Fig. <a href="#image395a">770</a>). Busts
were also made; but as these and the examples made at Plymouth are not
marked, and are made of the same body, and by the same workmen, it is
manifestly impossible to correctly appropriate them.</p>

<p>The mark which usually denotes Bristol porcelain is a plain saltire,
or cross, in blue, neutral tint, or red, sometimes with the addition
of figures or other marks, but more commonly by itself. The figures
probably denoted the workman, not the pattern, as on the same sets
different numbers appear, which would not be the case if the design
was denoted. The following are varieties of the mark, the cross being
sometimes in one colour, and the figure or character in another. One,
it will be seen, bears, besides the saltire, the sign for a drachm (or
perhaps figure 3), and another the Greek character epsilon (ε). These
marks occur the one on a teapot, the other on a saucer lately in the
possession of Mr. Norman. The letter B also sometimes occurs painted
in the same manner as the cross, and also in combination with figures,
&amp;c. (Figs. <a href="#image396">783 to 786</a>.) Other marks have been ascribed to Bristol,
but many of them, I believe, wrongly. In Mr. James’s collection was a
small fluted cream-boat, blue and white, with an unusual mark, the blue
cross, above which is an embossed letter T, as shown on Fig. <a href="#image396">789</a>. The
same mark occurs on a specimen in the Nightingale collection. Another
mark variously ascribed to Bristol and Bow is To (Fig. <a href="#image396">790</a>), and one very early trial piece in the Edkins
collection bears the unique mark of the word B r i s t o l l in relief.
The Dresden mark of crossed daggers occasionally occurs in connection
with the cross or the letter B; the latter marks being in some instance
painted <i>over</i> the former, and in others close by (Figs. <a href="#image396">791 to 796</a>).
Other marks said to be Bristol are shown on Figs. <a href="#image396">799 and 800</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Owen, to whom I have had occasion many times to refer in the
course of this chapter on Bristol china, and to whom I must offer my
congratulations on the successful issue of his labours and on the boon
he has conferred on the literature of ceramics by his researches and by
the elegant volume in which those researches are recorded, gives many
interesting particulars regarding Champion’s workmen and apprentices.
The following notes upon workmen may be useful for reference:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Anthony Amatt; a thrower and meritorious painter, who died
in 1851, aged 92. He is said to have been born at Derby in
1759, and to have been apprenticed to a thrower who worked at
Champions, and to have worked there till their close.</p>

<p>Moses Hill; a china maker, 1775–6 (probably from Derby).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span></p>

<p>John Britain; foreman, whose initials
<img src="images/image397.jpg" alt=""
style="height:1.5em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">
appear on some pieces.</p>

<p>Thomas Briand (probably Bryan); a flower modeller in 1777, who
came from Derby.</p>

<p>B. Proeffell; a German, supposed to be engaged on the “blue and
white ware.”</p>

<p>M. Saqui (not Le Quoi, as Mr. Owen supposes); a clever painter
and modeller.</p>

<p>William Fifield; a painter. He worked as an enameller at the
Water Lane Pottery, and died in 1857, aged 80. Mr. Owen,
carefully correcting Marryatt, says: “He is said to have worked
for Champion, but this is simply impossible, as he was not born
till 1777, and Champion’s labours concluded in 1781,” when he
was only four years old.</p>

<p>Philip James; a china painter in 1775.</p>

<p>Mrs. James; modeller, mother of the late well-known and
respected collector, Mr. Edwin James, of Bristol.</p>

<p>Henry Bone (the celebrated enameller). He is shown, by Mr.
Owen, to have been apprenticed on the 20th of January, 1772,
to “Richard Champion, China Manufacturer, &amp; Judith his wife,
for seven years.” He was born at Truro, in February, 1755, so
that at the date of his apprenticeship to Champion he would
be seventeen years old. The presumption is that young Bone,
whose father was a cabinet-maker at <i>Plymouth</i>, was
originally apprenticed to Cookworthy at Plymouth, and became a
“turn-over,” with re-apprenticeship, to Champion. He became an
R.A. in 1811, and died full of honours in 1834.</p>

<p>William Stephens; son of William Stephens, of Plymouth, and, in
1771, of Bristol. Apprenticed to Champion on the same day as
Bone, and probably also a “turn-over” from Cookworthy. He was a
china painter.</p>

<p>John Hayden; china painter, of the same family as Benjamin
Hayden, R.A. He was the son of John Hayden, of Plymouth,
shoemaker, and was apprenticed to Champion on the same day
as Bone and Stephens, and the probability certainly is that
these three Plymouth youths, all apprenticed on the same day
to Richard Champion, who succeeded to the Plymouth works, were
transferred to him by Cookworthy and re-apprenticed.</p>

<p>Samuel Daw, apprenticed January 23rd, 1772.</p>

<p>Samuel Andrews Lloyd, apprenticed December 31st, 1772. He was
son of Edward Lloyd, merchant, of Bristol, and nephew of Mrs.
Champion.</p>

<p>Jacob Alsop, apprenticed as a china painter June 18th, 1773.
Son of Uriah Alsop, coalminer, of Stapleton.</p>

<p>Samuel Banford, apprenticed as a china painter same day. Son of
Thomas Banford, of Berkeley.</p>

<p>John Garland, apprenticed as a china painter same day. Son of
Richard Garland, of Bristol, labourer.</p>

<p>William Wright, apprenticed as a china painter April 8th, 1775.
Son of Wm. Wright, of Wotton-under-Edge.</p>

<p>John Parrot, apprenticed as a “burner of china” November 22nd,
1775. Son of John Parrot, of Bristol, house painter.</p>

<p>Benjamin Lewis, apprenticed as a china painter December 5th,
1775. Son of John Lewis, of Llandoger.</p>

<p>Samuel Begnon, apprenticed January 29th, 1776. Son of John
Begnon, late of Bristol, joiner.</p>

<p>Thomas Williams, apprenticed September 19th, 1776. Son of Thos.
Williams, of Bristol, labourer.</p>

<p>John Jones, apprenticed same day. Son of Samuel Jones, of
Bristol, carpenter.</p>

<p>Samuel Fiander Pagler, apprenticed as a china painter October
24th, 1776. Son of Thos. Paglar, of Bristol, mason.</p>

<p>John Webb, apprenticed as a china painter July 26th, 1777. Son
of John Webb, of Bristol, shoemaker.</p>

<p>William Webb, apprenticed as a china painter same day. Son of
Isaac Webb, of Bristol, stocking-maker.</p>

<p>James Saunders, apprenticed as a china painter same day. Son of
James Saunders, of Bristol, potter.</p>

<p>Edward Stephens, apprenticed July 17, 1776, to John Britain,
foreman to Champion. Son of William Stephens, and brother to
William Stephens already apprenticed to Champion.</p>

<p>William Lyne, apprenticed July, 1778. The last apprentice to
the works.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Bristol Earthenware.</h3>

<p><i>Temple Backs.</i>—In 1786 the pottery for fine earthenware was
established at No. 9, Water Lane, Temple Street, called “Temple Back,”
by Joseph Ring, as I have shown in my notice of that potter and his
delft-ware productions on page 354. In January, 1787, the following
highly interesting advertisement appeared in the <i>Bristol Gazette and
Public Advertiser</i>:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Bristol Pottery, Temple Back.—Joseph Ring<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> takes this
opportunity to inform merchants and others that he has
established a manufactory of the Queen’s and other earthenware,
which he will sell on as low terms, wholesale and retail, as
any of the best manufacturers in Staffordshire can render the
same to Bristol.”</p>

<p>In December of the same year, as is shown by an invoice of goods, the
following goodly variety of articles was made: “oval dishes,” 10, 11,
12, 13, and 14 inches respectively; “table plates;” “soups;” “suppers;”
“twifflers;” “tureens;” “quart jugs;” “pint jugs;” “sallad dishes;”
“coffee-pots;” “sugar dishes with covers;” “coffee cups;” “bowles;”
“coffee cups and saucers, paynted;” “table plates, paynted;” “twifflers
paynted;” “quart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span> mugs variagated;” and “pint mugs variagated.”
Mr. Ring’s friend and assistant, John Bettington, commemorated the
establishment of this new manufacture by writing some songs for the
Martinmas hiring festivities of the workmen. Two of these are printed
by Mr. Owen. The first is entitled “The Bristol Pottery, by J.
Bettington,” and is as follows:—</p>

<p>On the 5th of April, 1788, “Mr. Joseph Ring, potter, in Temple Street
was unfortunately killed by the falling in of a warehouse. He has
left a widow and nine children to lament his loss.”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span> was
superintending some alterations at the time, when the roof fell in, and
he was killed in the presence of his wife. The business was carried
on as usual “by the widow of the late Joseph Ring, and late partners,
under the firm of Ring, Taylor, and Carter.” The commemorative song of
this year is curious. It is as follows:—</p>

<p>In 1797 these works are described as “a large pottery,” so they must at
that time have been very extensive. In that year a curious reference
to “two gentlemen of the name of Ring,” sons, no doubt, to Joseph
Ring, occurs in the account of the death of James Doe, a potter who
worked there under them, which I have given under the head of Lambeth
(see page 137, <i>ante</i>). A mug bearing his name, “J. Doe, Sept.
1797,” is engraved in Mr. Owen’s book. In 1813 a deed of partnership
between Joseph Ring (son of the late owner), Henry Carter, and John D.
Pountney was drawn up, but through the death of the first-named was not
executed. The business was therefore carried on by Pountney and Carter,
under the style of Elizabeth Ring &amp; Co., until 1816, when Carter
retired and was succeeded by Edward Allies, the style being Pountney
and Allies. In 1825–6 it was, according to Chilcott’s and Matthews’
Guides, worked by the firm of Pountney and Allies, and at that time
gave employment to about two hundred persons. Mr. Allies retired in
1835, and in the following year Mr. Pountney took into partnership
Mr. Gabriel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span> Goldney, who retired in 1850. Mr. Pountney died in 1852,
and the works were then carried on by his widow under the style of
“Pountney &amp; Co.,” under the management of Mr. Clowes. In 1872, in
which year Mrs. Pountney died, the works were purchased by Mr. Halsted
Sayer Cobden, who also owns the Victoria Pottery, in Bristol, and by
whom they have been much extended, and give employment to about four
hundred hands. The goods produced are the ordinary classes of white and
printed earthenware, principally for exportation. During Mr. Pountney’s
lifetime, some parian figures, &amp;c., were made at these works; and
some exquisite examples, made by one of the workmen named Raby, who
removed into Staffordshire, were in the possession of the late Mrs.
Pountney, as were also some excellent imitations of the Etruscan and
other styles. Examples of the early productions of these works are
scarce, and it is interesting to state that the good old Bristol mark
of the cross was used on some of the pieces of earthenware here made.
The mark is sometimes in blue, and sometimes impressed. A name well
known in connection with these works is that of William Fifield (and
his son John), who was a painter of some merit. One of his plaques—a
sportsman with dog, gun, and glass—is, with other examples, in my own
possession. It bears on the back his initials, “W. F.,” and the words,
“Here’s to my Dog and my Gun, 1855.” The view of the works, painted
on four large tiles, and dated May 15th, 1820, now on the wall of the
office of the Water Lane Pottery (Fig. <a href="#image401a">802</a>), was also painted by him.</p>

<p><i>The Temple and St. Thomas’s Street Works.</i>—The oldest stoneware
pottery in Bristol is that of Mr. J. and C. Price and Brothers, in St.
Thomas’s Street and Temple Street, where their famous glazed stoneware
is made. It was established about 1735 or 1740, and has been continued
in work by three generations of the same family until the present day.
The old “Salt Glaze” was used till 1842, when great improvements having
been made through the long-continued and successful experiments of
Mr. Powell (as named in the notice of his works), it was at that time
found practicable to <i>dip</i> the stoneware into liquid glaze in its
green state, instead of first burning and then “smearing,” as formerly
practised. Messrs. Price, having adopted the new method, continued
to improve their works, and built much larger kilns than usual in
potteries of the kind. The superiority of “Bristol stoneware” over
others became so well established, that the metropolitan makers bought
their glaze from that city until very recently, and, indeed, I believe
some of them do so at the present day. The stoneware goods produced by
Messrs. Price are of the highest quality, and, besides the more homely
and useful articles, they have succeeded in making some excellent
imitations of the antique, of very fine body, faultless glaze, and
elegant form. Many of these are admirable copies from the antique, and
are perfect in shape and in firing. Among the goods produced by this
firm are filters of a remarkably simple but excellent construction and
of elegant form; feet and carriage warmers; barrels and churns; bread,
cheese, and other pans, and every other kind of domestic vessel, as
well as every possible size and variety of bottles, jugs, &amp;c. They
do an immense export trade for bottles for ale, stout, &amp;c., these
being found for the purpose far superior to glass. Messrs. Price also
make all the other usual varieties of stoneware goods, and all are of
faultless quality both in body and glaze.</p>

<p>Other stoneware potters besides those already named were, in former
times, John Hope,<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> in Temple Street; Thomas Patience,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> in the
same district; James Alsop, first at 9, Water Lane, and afterwards at
Temple Street, and others, as well as at Baptist Mills, Easton, and
Westbury.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Temple Gate Pottery.</i>—At Temple Gate a stoneware pottery
has long been established, and is still successfully carried on by
Messrs. William and Septimus Powell, the sons of its founder. The
goods manufactured at this establishment are what are generally termed
“Bristol ware” or “Improved stone,” which was invented and perfected
some forty years ago by the late Mr. Powell. “Its peculiarity consists
in its being coated with a glaze which is produced simultaneously
with the ware itself, so that one firing only is needed.” So great
was Mr. Powell’s success in his discovery, that “shortly after its
introduction at the Temple Gate Pottery almost every other manufacturer
of stoneware adopted it, and it has now, in a large measure, superseded
the old salt-glazed ware.” The goods principally made by the present
proprietors, Messrs. W. &amp; S. Powell, are bread-pans, filters,
foot-warmers, and other domestic vessels, as well as bottles and
jars of every size, shape, and use. Messrs. Powell have a registered
arrangement for fitting, fastening, and keeping air-tight, by means
of a three-pronged, or tripod, iron clamp furnished with an elastic
washer, the lids of preserve and other jars—thus doing away with the
necessity of any other covering. At these works, too, vases and bottles
of classic shape are occasionally made, as are also enormous jugs—one
of which, capable of holding twenty-five gallons, has been exhibited by
the firm.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Wilder Street Pottery.</i>—About 1820 a pottery on a small scale
was worked in Wilder Street by a family named Macken, a descendant
of the owner of the old pottery at St. Ann’s, at Brislington, where
flower-pots and other coarse brown ware was made. Macken afterwards
went to America.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Bristol Glass.</h3>

<p>As the manufacture of enamelled glass in Bristol is so intimately mixed
up with that of pottery and china, it may be interesting to add a few
words concerning it. In 1761 there appears to have been, according
to Evans, “fifteen large houses employed in that manufacture.” The
main source of information concerning the manufacture is gained from
the books and papers of Michael Edkins, to whom I have referred in my
notice of the delft-ware pottery. For the particulars gleaned from
these papers I am indebted to his descendant, Mr. William Edkins. The
ledger commences in May, 1761.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span></p>

<p>The glass made at Bristol appears to have been principally white,
of different shades, and was made in a great variety of articles,
including teapots, jugs, cream ewers, beakers, &amp;c. The commoner
varieties of decorative glass were painted in a rapid style with
varnish colour, and submitted to a gentle heat, just sufficient to fix
it on the surface. This, of course, soon rubbed off in use, and on the
examples which are still remaining the patterns have almost disappeared.</p>

<p>The highest class of goods produced by Mr. Edkins was beautifully and
perfectly enamelled, the colours were remarkably good, and thoroughly
incorporated into the glass. Examples of this kind are very rare, but
one or two specimens still remain in the family and are highly prized.</p>

<p>As the prices charged by Michael Edkins for painting on glass, and
for enamelling, naturally become a guide to the prices he had been
paid as a painter on delft-ware, and further as a guide to the prices
of painting on china at that time, I append a few extracts from his
ledger, which will be read with interest by collectors. For these
extracts I am indebted to Mr. William Edkins, of Bristol, grandson of
the painter, who has the original book in his possession. The accounts
for painting and enamelling on glass extend from April, 1762, to
December, 1787. The following are a few of the items:—</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Salt Glaze.</h3>

<p>It is said that the delft-ware potteries were preceded by a maker of
salt-glazed stoneware—a German named Wrede or Read—and a curious
story is told in connection with him and the difficulty he had in
establishing his works. It appears that the people being surprised at
the glaze he produced on his ware, and at the secrecy he endeavoured to
preserve regarding his pottery, and noticing the dense clouds of vapour
which every now and then arose from his kiln (caused, of course, by
the throwing in of the salt through the fire holes when the ware had
arrived at a certain degree of heat), believed that he had called in
supernatural aid, and that the fumes which ascended were caused by the
visits of the devil. He was “mobbed” by the people, his place injured,
and he was forced to fly the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span></p>


<h3 class="smcap">Brislington.</h3>

<p>About a century ago, I am informed, there was a pottery at St.
Ann’s, in this parish, conducted by a family named Macken. The older
productions are described as “a drab-coloured ware with a plum-coloured
glaze; the more modern were the same ware covered with a layer
resembling porcelain; white, and apparently of felspar, this kind has
almost invariably a rough blue pattern.” One of the Macken family had a
pottery in Bristol.</p>

<p>A manufactory formerly existed at this place, and the ware produced
may be described as very closely approaching, in general appearance
and effect, the common descriptions of Turkish pottery. The patterns
were produced, in coarse and rude designs, in a kind of copper or red
lustre, on the plain buff clay ground. Examples are somewhat rare. The
works were carried on by Richard Frank, of Bristol, and his family,
but were closed in the latter part of last century. The works, which
were of course but small, still stand, but are converted into cottages.
“They are situated at the bottom of St. Ann’s Wood, between St. Ann’s
Vale and the river, on a line about half a mile beyond Netham Dam,”
and opposite to Crewshole. Some good examples of this ware, which is
remarkably clumsy and coarse, but very curious, are preserved in the
Bristol Museum (Fig. <a href="#image406">804</a>). The circular dish is fourteen inches in
diameter with a small centre of nine inches. On its back is the rude
monogram (Fig. <a href="#image406">805</a>) of Richard Frank, its maker.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Crews-Hole.</h3>

<p>A small stoneware pottery was established here by a clever but somewhat
peripatetic potter, Anthony Amatt, originally of Derby, who was one
of the workmen employed by Richard Champion at the famous Bristol
china works. His works were merely a wooden shed or two, and the
bulk of his productions were flower-pots. He afterwards, I believe,
had a small pottery at Temple Gate, which came into the hands of Mr.
Powell when Mr. Amatt entered into his employ. Previous to this it is
believed a small pottery for producing the same kind of ware as that
of Brislington had existed at Crewshole. In 1794–5 Amatt was living at
Twerton, in Somersetshire; in those years he was extensively engaged in
painting on earthenware and china for Mr. Egan, of Bath, brother-in-law
of the second William Duesbury, of the Derby China Works. The original
bills are in my own possession. He was afterwards a stocking weaver.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Westbury.</h3>

<p>The <i>Sugar House Pottery</i> at Westbury, which had been for many
years carried on by George Hart, passed, on the 8th of December, 1775,
into the hands of Stephen Fricker, potter and publican, who was host
of the Fountain tavern in High Street, Bristol. Besides sugar bakers’
moulds, which gave the name of “Sugar-house Pottery” to the works, the
usual classes of flower-pots, chimney-tops, puncheons, pitchers, and
other domestic coarse brown ware articles were made.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Easton.</h3>

<p>A small manufactory was established here for the manufacture of various
articles by a process for using the magnesian limestone of the district
in its body. Many very creditable and artistic articles were produced,
but the whole affair proved a failure, and the works were closed. The
spill case (Fig. <a href="#image407">806</a>) is said to have been made here.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Weston-super-Mare.</h3>

<p>The <i>Royal Pottery</i> was established in 1836 by Mr. Charles
Phillips as a brick and tile manufactory. In the following year glazed
ware, for domestic vessels, was introduced, as was also, to a small
extent, the manufacture of flower-pots, &amp;c. In 1840 the production of
glazed ware was discontinued; and, the clay of the locality being found
to be admirably adapted for horticultural vessels, vases, statuary,
&amp;c., special attention was directed to them, and with such marked
effect that, at the Great Exhibition of 1851, medals and certificates
of merit were awarded for them. In 1870 Mr. Phillips retired from the
business, which was at that time purchased from him by the present
proprietor, Mr. John Matthews, by whom it has been very considerably
extended. By Mr. Matthews, too, several new branches have been
added to the business, and a new and better taste has been infused
into the art decorations. Notably among the new introductions are
rustic-work, baskets of artificial flowers, busts, vases, suspenders,
&amp;c. Flower-pots, of which from 20,000 to 30,000 are made weekly, and
of all sizes, from 1¾ inches to 30 inches in diameter, are a staple
production of the “Royal Pottery,” and are supplied to her Majesty’s
garden at Windsor Castle, H.M. Commissioners of Works at Kew, Hampton
Court, the Parks, &amp;c., the Royal Horticultural Society, Chiswick,
&amp;c., and to most of the principal gardens in this country, as well
as being exported in large quantities to New Zealand, Port Natal,
and Chili. They have the reputation of being the best, most compact,
and most durable of any manufacture; and, although of such enormous
size, are turned with marvellous precision, and fired without running
or casting. Two great, and registered, specialities] are the “Oxford
Pot” with perforated rim for training pelargoniums, azaleas, roses,
&amp;c., without the aid of sticks, and the “Alpine-plant pot”—a kind of
double pot so arranged that the space between the outer one and the
inner one (in which, of course, the plant is set) can be filled with
water or moist moss. The more notable ornamental productions of the
“Royal Pottery” are figure, shell, and other fountains, of various
tiers in height; life-size figures and groups of figures; statuettes
and busts; reproductions of ancient statuary; eagles, lions, and other
gigantic figures on artificial rocks and pedestals; flower and other
brackets in considerable variety; vases and tazzas of every conceivable
form, many of which, peculiar to these works, are of remarkable
elegance;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span> pedestals and garden-seats; flower-vases and flower-stands,
elaborately and elegantly decorated in relief; fern-stands and flower
and fern-baskets, with and without handles, charmingly decorated in
relief with wicker-work, fern-leaves, and other ornamentation; cut
flower-baskets and vases; crocus pots; elegant suspenders for flowers,
for use in conservatories, entrance-halls, archways, &amp;c.; orchid pots,
of greatly improved form and construction; window-boxes for flowers;
stump or rustic arborettes, of various sizes, for lawns, rockeries,
parterres, &amp;c., of the most striking and novel character; rockery
arborettes for ferns, lychopods, &amp;c., of various sizes, either for
out or in-door use; and architectural decorations, &amp;c. The general
colour of these productions is a delicate red, which is calculated to
harmonize well with surrounding foliage. The designs of the vases,
&amp;c., are remarkably good, bold, and effective; the body durable and
hard; the colour pleasing, and the workmanship faultless. The greatest
achievement of Art in terra-cotta which has ever been gained is the
production of baskets of flowers, each individual leaf or flower
modelled from nature; and vases decorated in the same manner. Those who
are acquainted with the exquisite beauty of the groups of porcelain
bisque flowers produced at the old Bristol and Derby works, will
scarcely be prepared to believe that they are successfully vied in the
coarser material by Mr. Matthews. But such is the case, and hence it is
that I call attention to these new and beautiful ceramic productions.
So true to nature are many of the flowers, and so delicately modelled
in all their minutest details, that the most skilful botanist can
scarce find a deviation from nature in leaf or flower. The basket
engraved on Fig. <a href="#image409">807</a> is a fair specimen of the Matthews’ reproduction
of flowers; but the most exquisitely beautiful group yet produced is an
example in my own possession—the <i>chef-d’œuvre</i> of the works. It
is unsurpassed by any production in terra-cotta. These floral baskets
are a speciality of the Royal Pottery, and are among the most beautiful
of art productions.</p>

<p>The clay from which the various terra-cotta and other objects are
made is the native clay of the place, and is produced in the field
in which the works are situated. It is a fine plastic clay, of light
colour, and admirably adapted for the various purposes to which it
is being applied. The first six or eight feet in depth is this fine
plastic clay, from which the vases, statuary, busts, fern-stands,
flower-baskets, and other finer goods are made. Below this are several
feet in depth of blue clay, from which bricks, drain-pipes, &amp;c.,
are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span> made, and which lies in a bed of peat about fifteen inches in
depth. Below this peat is a considerable depth of soft clay, from
which the ordinary bricks are made. Roofing and flooring tiles, and
garden-edgings, are also made in large quantities. The following is an
analysis of the plastic clay made for the purpose of this account.</p>

<p>“Before analyzing, the clay was dried at the temperature of boiling
water.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Poole, Dorset.</h3>

<p><i>The Architectural Pottery Company’s</i> works were established in
1854 by Messrs. Thomas Sanders Ball, John Ridgway (china manufacturer,
of Cauldon Place, Hanley), Thomas Richard Sanders, and Frederick
George Sanders. In 1857, Mr. Ridgway retired from the concern and it
was carried on by the remaining partners until 1861, when Mr. Thomas
Sanders Ball also retired. Since then the works have been continued
by Messrs. T. R. and F. G. Sanders alone. The Company produce patent
coloured and glazed bricks and mouldings, semi-perforated and pressed;
patent mosaic, tessellated, encaustic, vitreous, and white, blue, and
other glazed wall tiles;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span> embossed and perforated tiles; quarries and
fire-clay goods, and other articles—the clays used being Purbeck clay,
Cornish china clay, and Fareham clay, while those for plain quarries
are from the Canford estate.</p>

<p>The encaustic paving tiles are of good design, many being carefully
copied from mediæval examples, while others are new and of extremely
good character—some being classic and others gothic. The colours
used in the encaustic tiles are very varied and, in some instances,
rich; red, buff, blue, chocolate, black, white, brown, green, &amp;c., of
different shades and of harmonious combinations. A speciality of these
works are the tessellated tiles, under Bale’s patent process. These
are literally formed of thin tesseræ of various colours, laid on and
forming a part of the quarry itself. By this means all the richness
and intricacy of the geometrical designs of tessellated pavements is
produced, and at small trouble in laying down. Their character, as a
rule, is better than the Italian tiles produced on the same general
principle. These “tessellated tiles”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span> possess every quality for general
adoption, and no doubt will, in time, become, so to speak, acclimatised
to this country. In quality the Architectural Pottery Company’s
decorated tiles are not so hard and compact in body as some others are,
but doubtless this can be improved upon.</p>

the manufacture of stoneware sanitary goods and terra-cotta, in 1855,
who also established alum works here. Fire-clay goods of the usual
quality of the district are made, and the sanitary pipes are of a hard
and durable nature. The works have the advantage of a large bed of
excellent clay close at hand.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Kinson.</h3>

<p>The works at Kinson, near Poole (with a wharf at the Albert Embankment,
Lambeth), were established in the middle of the present century, and
consisted of twelve kilns with boiler, engine-house, drying-sheds,
stables, offices, &amp;c. After a few years they were closed, and so
remained until 1867, when the property was purchased and came into the
hands of the present “Kinson Pottery Company,” who commenced making
stoneware drain-pipes. Shortly afterwards the company introduced the
making of terra-cotta goods,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[414]</span> in which they have been very successful,
and fire-bricks, which they manufacture to a very considerable extent.
The estate consists of about twenty-seven acres of freehold land, which
is underlaid through its whole area with a thick compact bed of clay,
in layers of various descriptions. It is (roughly speaking) of three
qualities, about 40 feet thick, lying in nearly equal beds of each
description. The quality is shown in the following copy of Herapath’s
analysis, taken some years ago, for the original company:—</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Nottingham.</h3>

<p>That pottery and encaustic paving-tiles were made at Nottingham during
mediæval times is abundantly proved by the discovery, in April, 1874
(when digging the foundations for the Methodist New Connection chapel),
of kilns and examples of tiles and domestic vessels. Of this discovery
Mr. A. J. Sully gives me the following account:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As the men were excavating on the site of the old Parliament
Street Chapel at the lower corner of George Street, they came
on an old kiln, in and near which they found jars, jugs, and
flat-bottomed pots of mediæval manufacture, varying from six
to sixteen inches in height and from two to nine inches in
diameter; they are all of a red clay body, with the upper
portion of the outside covered with green salt glaze. They
afterwards found three other kilns and more pieces of the same
description, and a number of fragments of encaustic tiles
with coats of arms on, and one or two with inscriptions. In
the same place, they also found a number of silver pennies
of Edward I., II., and III., a few Irish types of Edward I.,
and pennies of Alexander of Scotland. But what proves most
conclusively that there was a pottery there, is the fact that
nearly all the pieces found are faulty, having been either
broken, or fallen in shape in the oven, and therefore thrown
aside; and the coins, tiles, and pottery being all of the same
period, prove that the works must have been in existence as
early as the latter part of the fourteenth century. One of the
vessels is probably unique; it is of the shape of an inverted
water-bottle, and has a face in relief on each side—though
for what use it was intended I am unable to conjecture, as it
has an opening at the bottom as well as at the top. They were
all found within four feet of the surface, the walls of the
chapel having been built all round the place; but there being
no internal walls of any kind, the enclosed land had not been
disturbed before. Some kilns and fragments of a similar kind
were discovered about fifty years ago, when excavations were
being made on the site of St. Paul’s church, which is also
situated in Broad Street, but at a distance of about three
hundred yards from where this last find took place; so that the
works would seem to have been of a very extensive character,
and to have covered a large space of ground.”</p>
</div>

<p>The vessels seem to be of very much the same general character and
period as those found at Burley Hill, described on pages 78 and 79.
They consist principally of pitchers of almost identical form with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[416]</span>
those engraved on Figs. <a href="#image078b">266 to 269</a> and <a href="#image079a">272</a> and <a href="#image079b">274</a>. The most remarkable
is the one described by Mr. Sully as bearing a mask on either side.</p>

<p>In 1641 there appears, from a list of trades compiled in that year and
given by Dering, to have been only one master-potter at Nottingham. In
1693 “glass-pots”—<i>i.e.</i> crucibles for glass makers—were made
of Derbyshire crouch clay. This is thus alluded to by Houghton in that
year, “<i>clay with flat or thin sand glittering with mica</i>. Crouch
white clay, Derbyshire, of which the glass pots are made at Nottingham.”</p>

<p>In the beginning of last century Mr. Charles Morley was a manufacturer
of brown glazed earthenware in Nottingham. His works were in the
lower part of Beck Street, on the way to St. Ann’s Well. Mr. Morley,
who amassed a very considerable fortune by his pottery, built for
himself the large house in Beck Lane, which was afterwards occupied
by his son, the late Mr. Charles Lomas Morley, and still later used
as the Government School of Design. In 1737 Mr. Charles Morley, the
potter, was one of the Sheriffs of Nottingham. One of his principal
branches of manufacture was in brown ware ale-mugs, for the ale-houses
of the district, and in pitchers, and other domestic utensils. In
1739, according to a list of trades in that year, there were two
master-potters in Nottingham.</p>

<p>Dering, who wrote his “Nottingamia vetus et nova” in 1751, says that at
that time Nottingham sends down the river Trent “coals, lead, timber,
corn, wool, and potter’s ware.”</p>

<p>In 1772–4 it is stated, in a curious and scarce little work, “A Short
Tour in the Midland Counties of England,” that at Nottingham “the
making of glass wares is laid aside, and that of pots become very
trifling; but here are some small silk mills and also a few on the same
principle for cotton, lately erected.”</p>

<p>In 1774 the names of thirteen “pot-makers,” one “mug maker,” and four
“pipe makers” occur in “An exact List of the Burgesses and Freeholders
of the town and county of Nottingham,” who voted at the election of
Members of Parliament in that year, but of course these would mainly be
journeymen. The names, which I here extract from a copy of this scarce
book in my own possession, are as follows:—</p>

<div class="parent1">
<ul class="left smaller" style="margin-top: 0em">
  <li>John Ash, pot maker, Bottle Lane.</li>
  <li>William Barns, pot maker, Barkergate.</li>

  <li>Moses Colclough, pot maker, Beck Barn.</li>
  <li>John Coppock, pot maker, Marsdens Court.</li>
  <li>Thomas Ellnor, pot maker, St. James’s Lane.</li>
  <li>Thomas Glover, pot maker, Warser Gate.</li>
  <li>John Handley, mug maker, Coalpit Lane.</li>
  <li>John Hazeley, pot maker, Bridlesmith Gate.</li>
  <li>Thomas Hough, pot maker, Beck Lane.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[417]</span></li>

</ul>
</div>  

<p>In 1780, in “An exact list of the Burgesses of the town and county of
the town of Nottingham, who polled in the election of two Burgesses to

<p>In 1802, in a List of the Burgesses in the Free Library<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> the
following four names occur;—</p>

<div class="parent1">
<ul class="left smaller" style="margin-top: 0em">
  <li>Moses Colclough, potter, Beck Court.</li>
  <li>John Key, pot maker, Coalpit Lane.</li>
  <li>John Reynolds, potter, Barker Gate.</li>
  <li>Samuel Woodhouse, pot maker, Sandy Lane.</li>
</ul>
</div>  

<p>In the list of those who voted at the contested election of 1803, only
one pot-maker appears. In the same list the “Old Pottery” is mentioned
as a place of residence of several persons, thus showing that the
manufacture had then ceased at that place.</p>

<p>In 1815, Blackner in his history of Nottingham says, “there were
likewise two potteries within the last thirty years,” “but the clay was
principally brought from a considerable distance, which added so much
to the cost of the pots as to prevent the proprietors maintaining a
competition with the Staffordshire dealers.”</p>

<p>The names of “Mug-House Yard” and “Mug-House Lane” in Beck Street,
take their origin from the old pot works of Mr. Morley, and show,
incontestably, that those works, where “mugs” were the staple
production, were known as the “Mug-house.”</p>

<p>The greater part of the clay was brought from out of Derbyshire, but
some is said also to have been procured from Hucknall Torkard.</p>

<p>The earliest known dated example of Nottingham ware is the remarkably
fine posset-pot (Fig. <a href="#image418b">812</a>), in the possession of my friend, the Rev. J.
S. Doxey, by whom it was thus described for my “Reliquary”:—<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[418]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is a Posset-pot of the general form (Jewitt’s “Life of
Wedgwood,” pp. 64–65), fashioned with more than ordinary care
and lightness. It is made of very hard and durable ware, and
has, as usual, a light brown lustrous glaze. It stands 10½
inches, and at the top is 9½ inches in diameter. It is of a
very unusual mode of construction, the ‘belly’ part having
double sides, the outer of which is ornamented with foliage
and flowers, the stalks being incised and the flowers and
leaves being perforations. There is, moreover, the following
remarkable peculiarity, which may be partially seen in the
engraving. A tube commencing about an inch from the top, is
passed down the exterior side as far as the top of the ‘belly,’
where it passes through and is continued to the bottom of the
interior. This tube, I imagine, had originally a mouth-piece,
which is unfortunately broken off, and was so constructed that
a draught of the posset liquor could by suction be taken apart
from the bread, spices, &amp;c. Between the handles, on the upper
part, on the tube side, is inscribed in cursive characters the
following:—</p>

  </div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Occupying a space 5 inches broad and 5½ in height, on the
other side, in a similar position are to be seen the Royal
arms of the period (William III.) with crest, supporters, and
garter, with motto. Though this cup is of the same general form
as the Posset-pot, and may have been used as such, it may also
have been used on occasions of mayoral and other hospitality as
a ‘loving-cup,’ or as some would prefer to call it, from its
having only two handles, a ‘parting-cup.’ Samuel Watkinson, the
owner of the Posset-pot, or in whose honour it was made, was no
mean person. From Throsby’s Thoroton’s ‘History of Nottingham,’
I learn he was elected on three several occasions (1700, 1708,
1715) Mayor, or as it is more correctly put on the Posset-pot,
Major of Nottingham.”</p>
</div>

<p>In Mr. Briscoe’s possession is a good specimen of the brown mugs so
characteristic of Nottingham ware. It is 5½ inches in height, 2⅞ inches
in diameter at the bottom, and wider at the top, and will hold about
half a pint. It was discovered during excavations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[419]</span> in Victoria Street,
Nottingham, close to the site of the Old Ship inn, of “Gideon Giles”
notoriety.</p>

<p>One of the finest mugs which has come under my notice—and indeed, I
believe, the finest known example—is in the possession of Mr. E. M.
Kidd, of Nottingham, who is also the fortunate possessor of a fine
collection of English china. It is engraved on Figs. <a href="#image419a2">813 and 814</a>. In
front is a full-blown rose on a stem, surmounted by a crown, and there
are two other crowns, one on either side, a little lower down, between
what are evidently intended for thistles; there is also a terminal rose
at each end, and the remainder of the body is ornamented with their
stems and foliage. At the back, by the handle, are the words</p>

</table>

<p>This inscription is, as usual, in ordinary writing letters, incised,
or scratched, into the soft clay. On the bottom, in the same kind of
incised writing letters, is the maker’s name, <i>W<sup>m</sup> Lockett</i>.
This is highly interesting, as he, William Lockett, is one of the
makers included in the foregoing lists of voters in 1774 and 1780.
The name stands thus in the 1774 list:—“Lockett William, pot-maker,
<i>New buildings</i>” (in 1780 he was of <i>St. Ann’s Street</i>),
and he appears to have given a plumper for the Hon. William Howe,
of Epperstone. In the same list is a Henry Lockett, saddler, Smithy
row, who voted in the same manner. In the same list the name of the
school-master, for whom this special mug was made also occurs, but he
voted for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[420]</span> Lord Edward Bentinck, and Sir Charles Sedley, of Nutthall,
Bart. The name stands thus:—“Johnson John, school-master, <i>St.
Mary’s Church side</i>.”</p>

<p>Thus a record occurs both of the maker and the owner of this curious
mug, of which Mr. Kidd is the fortunate possessor.</p>

<p>A jug formerly belonging to Mr. Norman has the inscription, incised in
writing letters, as follows:—</p>

<p class="center smaller">“<i>John Smith junr of Bassford near</i><br>
<i>Nottingham 1712</i>”</p>

<p>In the Museum of Practical Geology is a “christening bowl,” thirteen
inches in diameter bearing the incised words, in writing letters,
“<i>Nouember</i> 20 1726;” a punch-bowl, twenty-two inches in diameter,
with the words “Old England for Ever, 1750;” and a highly interesting
mug “in brown earthenware with glaze of metallic lustre, ornamented
with stamped flowers laid on in relief, and incised inscription in
cursive characters, round the rim, ‘<i>Made at Nottingham ye 17th Day
of August A.D. 1771.</i>’”</p>

<p>Another good, dated example, brought under my notice by Mr. Briscoe,
bears the names of “<i>Thos. and Mary Brammer, May ye 21 1753.</i>”
In the collection formerly belonging to Mr. Hawkins was “a neatly
formed puzzle jug, of lustrous glaze, ornamented with a vase of pinks
[these flowers being most generally used in the ornamentation of the
Nottingham Pottery] and scrolls around the lower part, the flowers
being a dark red colour; on the front is the date 1755, underneath the
bottom, the initials, ‘G. B.’” In the same collection was “a tobacco
jar, in form of a bear, of bright lustrous glaze, his head being the
cover, a collar round his neck, and a chain, to which is attached a
large hollow ball, containing stones and holes, used as a rattle; on
the ball is impressed the name “Elizabeth Clark, Dec<sup>r</sup> ye 25<sup>th</sup>
1769.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[421]</span></p>

<p>One of the favourite productions of the Nottingham “Mug-house” and its
predecessors, was drinking jugs in form of a bear, which were also
made at Brampton in the same kind of ware, and at Fulham and other
places in other wares. A strikingly good example (Fig. <a href="#image420">815</a>) is in my
own possession. It is 9½ inches in height, and formed of the usual hard
brown glazed ware of this pottery. The whole, with the exception of the
neck, is powdered with small fragments of dry clay (not “potsherds” as
usually, but erroneously, stated) which have been sprinkled over its
surface before firing and burnt in with it. This, it may be remarked,
is the usual characteristic of these vessels whenever made. The one
under notice has the eyes, outlines of the ears, teeth, and claws,
laid on in white “slip.” It, like many other “bears,” is made to rest
as in the engraving, or to stand upright when placed on its hams;
the body contains the liquor, and the head lifts off to be used as a
drinking-cup, holding it by the muzzle.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Lowesby.</h3>

<p>In 1835 Sir Frederick Gustavus Fowke, Bart., commenced some Terra Cotta
Works at Lowesby, in Leicestershire, and produced vases of very good
character and of remarkably hard and fine body from the clays of the
neighbourhood. He had previously, about 1833, made some garden-pots
for his own use, and finding the clay remarkably good and tenacious,
determined upon utilising it. In colour the terra cotta was a full
rich red, and in some cases the articles were decorated with Etruscan
figures and ornaments in black enamel. Vases, ornamented flower-pots,
butter-pots, and other articles of domestic use, were produced, and
these were mostly decorated with patterns in black, or occasionally in
colours, and gilt.</p>

<p>A shop for the sale of the Lowesby ware was opened in King William
Street, London, under the management of a Mr. Purden. The ornamental
vases, made of different sizes, were sent up to London as they came
from the kiln, and many of the antique shapes were beautifully painted
and enamelled in London under Mr. Purden’s superintendence. The
manufacture was only continued for a few years and then, not being
found to answer, died out. The place is now used as a brick and tile
works, and flower-pots are also made.</p>

<p>The mark is impressed on the bottom of the ware. It is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[422]</span> fleur-de-lis,
beneath the name “<span class="allsmcap">LOWESBY</span>” in a curved line (Fig. <a href="#image422">816</a>).
Occasionally the name <span class="allsmcap">LOWESBY</span> without the fleur-de-lis occurs.
The arms of Sir Frederick G. Fowke, Bart., the founder of the works,
are, <i>vert</i>, a fleur-de-lis, <i>argent</i>, and the seat is
Lowesby Hall, so that the mark represented time armorial bearing of the
family, and the name of the estate.</p>

<h3 class="smcap" id="Coalville">Coalville.</h3>

<p>In 1859 the attention of Mr. George Smith (who has made himself a name,
and earned the thanks of his country for his philanthropic exertions
in improving the condition of the brick-yard children and those of
the canal population) was accidentally drawn to the clays of the
neighbourhood of Coalville and Whitwick, and he procured some for the
purpose of experiments. These trials proving eminently satisfactory,
Mr. Smith entered into an arrangement with Mr. Joseph Whetstone and
others by which he undertook to establish the manufacture of terra
cotta on the spot and to develop the clay resources of the place.
The works were therefore established in connection with the Whitwick
Colliery Company, at Coalville and Ibstock; they are now worked by
the Midland Brick and Terra Cotta Company. Three kinds of terra cotta
are here produced, viz., red, white or light buff, and yellow or
cream colour. These varieties, each distinct from the other, are thus
described for me by Mr. Smith:—</p>

<p>“First, the red. This is made out of the surface clay, of a greyish
tint, and varies in thickness from four to thirty feet, and does not
shrink much in burning; it burns a beautiful bright red colour and
will stand the severest weather and keep its colour. Occasionally a
little white scum may be seen on the surface: this is the result of
making, drying, and burning too quickly; but this will disappear after
it has been in use a winter or so. Second, the light buff or glypto
terra cotta. The clay out of which this is made underlies the red terra
cotta clay and varies in thickness from six to twenty feet; it is very
hard and difficult to be ground to a proper fineness. This terra cotta
when burnt resembles very much Bath stone in colour, and may, if it
be kept dry from the time it is burnt to the time it is used, be cut
and carved with much ease, and it is very suitable for head-stones,
&amp;c. But this peculiar speciality disappears after it has been exposed
to the weather for a little time, when it gets hard, and turns the
edge of the tools. Third, the yellow or cream-coloured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[423]</span> terra cotta.
The clay for this kind of terra cotta is got out of the coal-pits in
the neighbourhood, and lies at a depth of about a hundred and twenty
yards from the surface. It averages about five feet in thickness, and
is a kind of clay between a pot-clay and a fire-clay. It is very fine,
strong, free from iron, and will stand a great heat, but shrinks a
deal in burning—about one-eighth. The kind of goods this clay is most
suitable for are the following:—Sewage-pipes, chimney-pots, vases,
flower-boxes, tiles, and pottery. The goods produced in architectural
enrichments are bases and capitals; cornices, corbels, and brackets;
arch moulds, vaulting-ribs, and balustrades; diapers, finials, and
ridge-tiles, and other articles. Garden and conservatory, as well as
table vases—some of which, especially a tripod vase, are of excellent
design—are also made of various sizes.”</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Ibstock.</h3>

<p>The history of these works is that of Coalville; which <a href="#Coalville">see.</a></p>


<h3 class="smcap">Polesworth.</h3>

<p><i>Terra Cotta Works.</i>—One of the manufactures of terra cotta
carried on by the “Midland Brick and Terra Cotta Company” is situated
at Polesworth. It was established in 1875, and the directorship placed
in the hands of Mr. J. Joiner, for many years principal manager at
the Stamford Terra Cotta Works. The productions consist of fountains;
garden, conservatory, and other vases of various designs; architectural
details and enrichments; chimney tops, chimney pieces, capitals and
columns, crestings and finials, and other articles, including an
admirable feature, that of tomb-stones, monuments, memorial tablets,
urns, &amp;c. Blue and brown bricks, both moulded and plain; coping, arch,
and stable bricks; roofing tiles, garden edgings, drain pipes, and
other useful goods are also extensively made. The terra cotta is both
red and buff, and is of fine hard and durable quality, and, with a
clean, good surface, unites a pleasant shade of colour.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Market Bosworth.</h3>

<p><i>Terra Cotta Works</i>, belonging to the “Midland” Company, before
spoken of, have been established for the production of bricks, tiles,
fire-clay, and the more ordinary terra cotta goods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[424]</span></p>


<h3 class="smcap">Tamworth.</h3>

<p>The <i>Terra Cotta Works</i> at Tamworth were established in 1847,
by the present owners, Messrs. Gibbs and Canning, and are now very
extensive and important, and produce a large variety of goods of the
highest class and character. The principal productions are terra-cotta
for architectural, horticultural, and other useful and ornamental
purposes; Della Robbia ware; sanitary and other goods; tiles, and
bricks, &amp;c. In terra cotta, for architectural purposes, trusses and
cornices, bosses and pateræ, brackets and corbels, capitals and bases,
balustrades and parapets, keystones and quoins, strings and mouldings,
window and door heads, terminals and finials, friezes, diaper work,
ashlar, and every other detail, are produced, and of a quality for
sharpness, hardness, and durability scarcely to be surpassed. Among
the buildings where this Tamworth terra cotta has been well introduced
are the Roman Catholic church of the Holy Name at Manchester;
the Royal Albert Hall, South Kensington; the Royal Horticultural
Gardens; the Colston Hall, Bristol; the Natural History Museum, South
Kensington; and the corridor of the New Town Hall, Manchester, &amp;c.
For ornamental purposes this firm produces fountains, vases, tazzas,
pedestals, garden-seats, brackets, suspenders, figures and groups,
garden-edging, and every variety of articles for the lawn, the garden,
or the conservatory. Many of these are of excellent design, and the
material being durable they are well suited for out-door purposes. The
“Della Robbia ware”—a fine terra cotta beautifully and effectively
enamelled in brilliant and flat colours on the surface—is produced
in endless variety in plaques, &amp;c., for ceilings and walls, where it
takes the place of plaster or other surface-covering. Its great beauty
is, however, especially apparent in the garden and flower-vases,
jardinières, mignonette-boxes, tree-pots, and an endless variety of
other useful articles which the firm produce. The designs are chaste
and elegant, especially those in which the convolvulus is introduced,
and the colouring rich and effective in the extreme. They are among the
best productions of this class of goods. Another excellent production
of the firm is a grey terra-cotta, which has a pleasing effect for
architectural enrichments.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Wilnecote.</h3>

<p>The <i>Wilnecote Works</i>, near Tamworth, which rank among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[425]</span> more
important in the kingdom, were established in 1860, when Mr. George
Skey purchased the coal mines at this place, with the intention
of working them. On sinking shafts for the purpose he fortunately
discovered several important and valuable beds of fire-clay, and other
clays well adapted for pottery purposes, and he wisely determined to
at once erect suitable kilns and buildings for their full development.
At great cost and under considerable disadvantages suitable workrooms
were erected and fitted up with suitable machinery, steam presses,
lathes, &amp;c. Competent workmen were engaged, and the manufactory was
opened in 1862. The goods produced were so well received and their
quality so good, both as regard material and workmanship, as well as
design, that the works had very shortly to be considerably enlarged and
fresh workrooms, kilns, &amp;c., erected. This was done, and at the present
time the entire produce of the coal and clay pits (about 300 tons of
coal and 300 tons of clay per week) is used up at the works, which
give employment to several hundred persons. In 1864 Mr. Skey having
found the concern grown to more than his own personal care could,
single handed, control, formed it into a limited liability company,
with a capital of £60,000, under the style of the “Wilnecote Company,
Limited,” afterwards altered to the “George Skey and Company, Limited,”
Mr. Skey being the managing director, and Mr. Thos. Creswell, secretary.</p>

<p>The goods produced are:—in terra-cotta, which is of fine and
durable quality, and of excellent workmanship, fountains, vases,
tazzas, brackets, pedestals, suspenders, terminals, flower-vases,
mignonette-boxes, fern-stands, garden-seats, balustrades, cornices,
chimney tops, and every description of architectural enrichment.
Game-pie dishes, of admirable design and of perfect modelling, and
other articles, are also produced in this material. The colour is
a beautiful light cream colour, and the body being very fine the
relief patterns “come out” very sharply and effectively. In “Rustic
ware,” vases, garden-seats, flower-pots, brackets, fern-stands, and
an infinite variety of beautiful articles are made. This “Rustic
ware” is a fine buff coloured terra-cotta, glazed with a rich brown
glaze, and sometimes heightened with a green tinge, just sufficient
to give it a remarkably pleasing effect. The modelling of some of
these goods is highly artistic. In stoneware, or Bristol ware, all the
usual articles as made at Lambeth, at Bristol, and other places, are
produced. In sanitary ware, all the usual and many additional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[426]</span> articles
are made; these are of remarkably fine and good quality and excellent
both in body and glaze, and in firing. In ridging and roofing-tiles,
sewerage-pipes, and garden-edgings, and in moulded bricks for cornices,
string courses, &amp;c., an endless variety; and in paving-tiles, and
facing-bricks of various colours, as well as fire-bricks, all the usual
kinds.</p>

<p>Terra-cotta gas-stoves are extensively made in various designs, some of
which are registered. They are chaste and even elegant in design, and
admirable in construction. Some of the patterns are in high relief, and
others, in addition to the relief, are perforated, and have a striking
and pleasing effect. Two of the designs are shown on Figs. <a href="#image426b">817 and 818</a>.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Coventry.</h3>

<p>At Stoke, near Coventry, and other places in the district, are old
established coarse brown ware works. Mr. Robt. Wakefield is a maker of
flower-pots, seakale-pots, &amp;c., of good quality.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Nuneaton.</h3>

<p>The works were established about 1830, by Mr. Peter Wager Williams,
upon the site of what evidently had been very old pot works, but of
which no record appears to exist. At first there were during Mr. P.
W. Williams’s lifetime two distinct manufactories. One of these was
next worked by his eldest son, Mr. John Williams, who sold it to his
three brothers, Peter, Charles, and James, by whom it was carried on
under the style of “Caroline Williams.” It passed by purchase into
the hands of Mr. J. Rawlins, and was taken by “Messrs. Broadbent and
Stanley Brothers,” by whom it was considerably extended. The other
manufactory was carried on by Mr. Walter Handley, at whose death it
passed to his son-in-law, Mr. David Wheway, at whose decease it was
incorporated with the former one, and carried on jointly with it, by
Messrs. Broadbent and Stanley Brothers. In 1871 Mr. Broadbent retired
from the concern, and it is now carried on by Messrs. Stanley Brothers.
The goods produced are terra-cotta vases, chimney-tops, &amp;c.; coloured
paving-tiles for geometric designs; garden-edging, ornamental ridging
and all kinds of plain building and ornamental bricks; glazed sanitary
and other pipes, &amp;c. The firm has recently patented a process for
the manufacture of malt kiln tiles, for which they have invented new
machinery. They are made of the finest fire-clay, and are of very
superior character to any others. The marls in this neighbourhood,
from which these various goods are made, are varied, and on the ground
worked by this firm alone about twenty different measures occur, and
these are of divers colours and qualities. The works occupy nearly ten
acres of ground.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Broxbourne.</h3>

<p>In 1843, when terra-cotta was but little known, Mr. Pulham turned his
attention to it, made numerous experiments in order to bring about
its revival, and succeeded in making it both of a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[428]</span> hard stone
colour and of a rich pale red. Having done this, he began to produce
various small objects for architectural purposes—bosses, angle quoins,
brackets, balustrades, small flower-pots, and vases—which remain at
the present day as sharp and good as when they left the kiln. He also,
about this time, introduced what is termed granulated terra-cotta,
having the appearance of stone. Latterly this imitation has fallen into
disrepute, and wisely so, for although where terra-cotta is now used
it is adopted instead of stone, yet it is not used to <i>imitate</i>
stone, but passes for what it is,—<i>bona fide</i> terra-cotta. For
architectural purposes, it is still, in some instances, granulated.</p>

<p>Mr. Pulham exhibited specimens of his work at the Exhibition of
1851. Notably amongst them was a handsome Gothic vase in rich pale
red, highly enriched; this was placed upon a suitable pedestal of
cream-colour terra-cotta. From that time down to the next Exhibition,
in 1862, improvements were constantly being made, both in the
manipulation, production, and style of the manufacture. Mr. Pulham
aimed more at the quality than quantity made; and it is said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[429]</span> that he
still carries out the rule he laid down, not to extend his business,
but to keep it so that it is not too large to be under his own personal
supervision. Mr. Pulham exhibited in 1862, among other things, a large
Fountain for a gentleman’s grounds near Tunbridge Wells, many features
of which, particularly the life-size figure of Hebe which surmounts it,
and which is a perfection in burning, were very successful.</p>

<p>In 1871, besides other of his productions, Mr. Pulham exhibited a small
fountain, which was at play during the whole time of the Exhibition;
and also several new vases. The fountains (for which a prize medal was
awarded) and principal exhibits were very favourably noticed. Some
of these I give on Figs. <a href="#image428">819 to 824</a>. At the Paris Exhibition in 1867
fountains, vases, and architectural embellishments, amongst which may
be named the Preston vase (a number of which were made for the People’s
Park, Preston), with medallions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[431]</span> representing the staple commerce
of the place; some rich columns, novel window jambs and dressings;
and notably amongst the rest was the Mulready Monument, erected
for the Science and Art Department, South Kensington, and at whose
instigation it was sent to Paris. The design of this is a pedestal 15
ft. by 10 ft., round the sides of which are sketched in outline some
of Mulready’s principal pictures. This pedestal supports a large-size
effigy, 7 ft. long, on a raised bier, the whole of this bier and effigy
being fired successfully, just as it left the sculptor’s and modeller’s
hands, and which was highly commended and spoken of as quite a <i>chef
d’œuvre</i> in the terra-cotta art, and obtained the silver medal. It
is now in Kensal Green cemetery, where it was fixed on its return from
Paris. Mr. Pulham also executed a portion of ornamental terra-cotta
used in the New Science Schools at South Kensington. The quality of
the terra-cotta produced at Broxbourne is very high; it is hard, firm,
compact, and durable, and of a soft and pleasing colour. Besides the
articles already named, Mr. Pulham produces a goodly variety of vases,
tazzas, pedestals, flower-baskets, and architectural enrichments of
every kind.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stamford.</span></h3>

<p>That pottery was in mediæval times made in Stamford was incontestably
proved in the latter end of 1874 by the discovery of a kiln during the
course of excavations in the rear of a house occupied by the Rev. E. F.
Gretton, formerly Master of the Grammar School there. The kiln was thus
described in “The Reliquary,”<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> by Mr. G. H. Burton:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On visiting the spot after a clearance had been effected, I
found an opening sunk in the ground, 7 feet wide, and as far
as excavated, 8 feet 6 inches long. The end that was bared
(north) was semicircular; the form of the other could not
be seen, though from certain indications I think it would
correspond. The bottom was floored with clay, and the lining or
‘bratticing’ of the sides was composed of stones, of irregular
shapes and sizes, set in and entirely faced with clay. The
layer forming the floor was about three inches thick, and had
been burnt to a rather deep red; the coating of the sides was
not so highly burnt, indeed; the clay at one part, only a few
inches from the face, became perfectly plastic by exposure
during a few days’ rain. In this opening, in the direction of
its length, was a row of four piers of an extreme height of 3
ft. 8 inches, and about 12 inches or 14 inches thick; their
section was something like a square or oblong, slightly rounded
at the angles—in some parts resembling a rough circle. These
columns were at somewhat irregular distances. That at the north
end supported a short, thick lintel, which was connected with
the enclosure, and was in a line with the series of piers. The
three other columns carried at their heads a slighter lintel.
These piers supported four horizontal beams 1 foot wide and
9 inches thick, of an extreme length of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[432]</span> 4 feet 6 inches,
which spanned the space between the piers and the east side of
the opening. Thus the internal arrangement, to use a homely
illustration, was pretty much that of a gridiron bent in the
middle to the shape of the letter L inverted.
<img src="images/image432.jpg" alt=""
style="height:1em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">
&nbsp;The part enclosed by the piers and beams was of the
clear width of 3 feet 6 inches; the space from the piers to
the other side was 2 feet 6 inches. This latter is believed to
represent the ‘stoke-hole,’ and the unbarred opening, between
the two northernmost piers, was perhaps a ‘man-hole.’ I have
been told that the four transverse beams had been continued
right across the opening, and that on one side they had been
accidentally destroyed; but one who was very early on the spot
assures me that the piers did not then present the appearance
of anything having been broken from them. The columns, the
beams, and the lintels were all of clay, burnt in some portions
to a light brick red. Their construction seems to have been
a rude and simple affair. Sticks or branches of no great
thickness were placed in position, and then soft clay was
clapped round them until the required massiveness was obtained,
when drying and baking would finish the operation, if indeed
drying and baking were necessary. Of what the superstructure
was composed, and what form it took, I could find nothing to
indicate. The floor of the kiln was seven or eight feet from
the present surface, and the sides at the highest remaining
part rose to a level with the horizontal beams. I should state
that in two parallel cuttings, made for the foundations of
new buildings, I observed a very thin layer of burnt earth
of a light colour, extending nearly to the south end of the
excavated remains of the kiln, and at about the same level as
the horizontal beams. This would seem to show that when the
kiln was in operation the tops of the pillars were on a level
with the then surrounding surface. One remarkable circumstance
ought, perhaps, to be mentioned. It was found necessary to
make a cutting through this kiln, and the excavation revealed
the fact, that for at least ten feet beneath the kiln floor
there was nothing but ‘made ground,’ as the workmen called it.
Other cuttings near disclosed a similar substructure, the loose
ground being 20 feet deep.”</p>
</div>

<p>The very large and important works of this place owed their origin
to Mr. J. M. Blashfield, by whom they were established in 1858.
Previous to that time, Mr. Blashfield had been, until 1851, engaged,
in Southwark Bridge Road, Albion Place, Blackfriars, and Mill Wall, in
the Italian marble trade, and the manufacture of cements and scagliola,
and the making and laying down of tessellated pavements, &amp;c. In that
year he commenced the manufacture of terra-cotta at Mill Wall, London,
having a few years previously purchased a number of the moulds,
models, &amp;c., from Coades when that manufactory was closed. In 1858 Mr.
Blashfield removed his moulds, models, plant, &amp;c., to Stamford, where
a splendid clay for his purpose exists, and where he soon became as
successful as such enterprise and ability as his deserved, and where he
did more for the development and improvement of the beautiful in art
than could otherwise have been accomplished. In 1874 the works merged
into a limited liability company, under the style of the “Stamford
Terra-Cotta Company,” which failed and was wound up in 1875, when the
plant and stock were sold by auction.</p>

<p>Mr. Blashfield’s name is very intimately connected with the subject
of encaustic paving-tiles, having been associated with the late Mr.
Herbert Minton in their revival. In reference to this the following
extract from a paper read by him is interesting:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[433]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One of the greatest revivals in pottery, connected with
architecture, took place about 1833. Mr. Wright, of Shelton,
obtained a patent for making inlaid tiles. This patent was
bought by the late Mr. Herbert Minton, who improved upon it,
and produced the tiles now so commonly used in churches.</p>

<p>“In 1840, Richard Prosser, of Birmingham, took a patent for
making buttons in china. In 1841, buttons made from the body of
which porcelain is constituted were very largely manufactured
by the late Mr. Herbert Minton, under this patent of Prosser’s;
and having, myself, for several years, made inlaid pavements
and imitations of old mosaic and tesselated work, I conceived
that Prosser’s invention would make <i>tesseræ</i> and tiles,
and I suggested to Minton and Prosser the enlargement of the
patent for this purpose. I then made arrangements to carry out
this invention, and laid the first designs and specimens I made
before the then President of the Royal Society (the Marquis
of Northampton), who kindly permitted me to exhibit them at
one of his soirées, at his house in Piccadilly, about the
commencement of the year 1843. He then introduced the subject
to a great number of noblemen, and especially to his Royal
Highness the Prince Consort, who requested an especial account
of the process to be written for him, and which was done, and
forms now the appendix to the second edition of a work I first
published in 1842, through Mr. Owen Jones, on <i>Tesselated
Pavements</i>. In 1843, I published a work upon <i>Encaustic
Tiles</i>, with ninety-six copies of ancient tiles drawn half
the full size, and also designs of pavements. The drawings were
arranged and copied on stone by Mr. Owen Jones. I also employed
Mr. Lewis, Mr. Kendall, and other architects on the same
subject, and especially Mr. Digby Wyatt, who copied for me in
Italy the remains of the mosaic works of the Middle Ages, from
San Lorenzo, St. Mark’s, and other places; and which has since
been drawn on stone, and published by him, under the title
of ‘The Geometrical Mosaics of the Middle Ages.’ The Society
of Arts, London, also kindly permitted me to lecture on the
subject, and constantly to bring it forward—so that, by the
end of the year 1845, the trade in tesselated pavements, inlaid
tiles, and Venetian floors, had gained a firm footing; but,
from various circumstances, and after spending many thousand
pounds in bringing the subject fully into notice, I was obliged
to surrender all interest in it to the manufacturer, Herbert
Minton. Since this date, Minton and Hollins have revived
the art of majolica and Palissy ware, and produced the most
magnificent specimens, both in point of size and color, ever
attained in this description of pottery.”</p>

  </div>

<p>Mr. Blashfield further wrote to me:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[435]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I suggested to Herbert Minton the making of mosaic pavements,
and found some of the money and designs for the early
development of the pavement business. It was the connection
with the pavement business that led me to a knowledge of
pottery; and made me turn the moulds and models which I had
used for plastic scagliola and cement castings into use for
terra-cotta in 1851. I began to form my collection of models in
1831 in the Southwark Bridge Road.”</p>
</div>

<p>The productions of this manufactory were terra-cotta as applied to
every purpose, glazed or enamelled tiles and bricks for wall-facings,
hard ordinary paving tiles, enamelled architectural enrichments for
internal use, and red and buff moulded bricks.</p>

<p>In this material, statues, both single figures and groups, busts,
vases, tazzas, fountains, pedestals, suspenders, chimney shafts,
cornices, consoles, string courses, pateræ, medallions, panels,
friezes, capitals and bases, tracery, window and door heads and
jambs, balustrades, and every species of architectural decoration
were produced in almost endless—and, certainly, as to design,
matchless—variety. The vases and tazzæ were most carefully modelled
from ancient examples taken from the British and other Museums, and
from the standard works of Montfaucon, Winckelmann, Millengen, Raoul
Rochette, Dubois-Maisonneuve, Baptista Passerio, D’Hancarville,
Piranesi, Tatham, Moses, Sir William Hamilton, Englefield, and
others; and many original designs by Mr. Blashfield and other artists
were added. These were produced of various sizes, but all of equal
excellence. The statues and busts, &amp;c., are clever reproductions of
ancient examples, and special works modelled for the purpose by or from
Bell, Woodington, Roubilliac, Weigall, Chantrey, and other renowned
modern artists.</p>

<p>Among the public buildings which have been enriched by the art works of
Mr. Blashfield’s manufactory are the urns, antifixa, and pavements in
the Royal Mausoleums, Windsor; vases and terminals, &amp;c., at Buckingham
Palace; vases, tazzas, borders, &amp;c., at Kew and Hampton Court Gardens
and Dairy Farm, Windsor; colossal statues, fountains, vases, &amp;c., and
roofs and other decorations, at the Crystal Palace; chimney shafts,
&amp;c., Sandringham; vases and pedestals, Marlborough House; the entire
red, buff, grey, and black terra-cotta details and enrichments for
Dulwich College; Lady Alford’s mansion, and many other places; and,
indeed, for most of the public buildings and private mansions of this
country and abroad. Of these, perhaps one of the most important, and
which will ever remain a lasting monument of Stamford ceramic art, is
the new Dulwich College, erected from designs by Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[437]</span> Charles Barry,
and entirely composed of terra-cotta. It is the most complete specimen
of terra-cotta building in England—no stone whatever being used; the
value of the material alone being, in the gross, calculated at £28,000.
The whole of this was made at these works.</p>

  </div>

<p>In colour and quality the Stamford terra-cotta is of faultless
excellence. The details are sharp, and in many cases exquisitely
moulded; and, the body being much finer and harder than usual, they
have a finish and a “touch” about them that cannot easily be surpassed.</p>

<p>One of the most striking series of subjects produced in terra-cotta
was the manufacturing “process panels” on the exterior of the Wedgwood
Memorial Institute at Burslem. Three of these are engraved on Figs.
<a href="#image436c">832 to 834</a>. The whole series, modelled by Mr. Walter J. Morris,
illustrate the various processes of the plastic art; those selected
for engraving represent “Turning,” “Painting,” and “Firing.” The
history of these panels is a somewhat interesting feature as connected
with Stamford terra-cotta works, and is worth briefly recording. The
whole of the clay for these large panels was prepared at the Stamford
works by Mr. Blashfield. A large case, lined with plaster of Paris,
was made for each panel; the clay was firmly and evenly pressed into
it, and thus each of the twelve was transmitted to South Kensington.
Mr. Morris wrought his modelling on the faces of these cases of clay,
and they were returned to Stamford when ready for the later process
to be accomplished. At Stamford they were cut up in suitable pieces
for “firing;” made true (for they had got considerably twisted and
warped during the time they were in the modeller’s hands), carefully
dried, and burned; the whole series coming out from the kiln in the
admirable and perfect state in which they now stand, as monuments of
Mr. Blashfield’s ceramic skill, in the Wedgwood Institute. The whole of
the operations in producing these panels occupied about twelve months
in time, and their cost, of course, was something considerable. They
were marked with Mr. Blashfield’s name.</p>

<p>Among the most successful vases was the “Shakspeare vase.” It is of
the Medici form, but the general allegorical design and details are
Mr. Blashfield’s own. The figures of the allegory, which run round the
body of the vase, were modelled by the late Mr. Nixon, who executed the
statue of William IV. for the City of London, in conjunction with his
father, also a sculptor of eminence. It represents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[438]</span> a masque scene from
Shakspeare’s <i>Tempest</i>—Prospero, Ferdinand and Miranda, with Juno
and Ceres, in front of the vase; Iris at the back, with the reapers,
dancers, &amp;c. Caliban forms the part of one handle and Sycorax the
other. The whole are moulded in a masterly manner, and the rest of the
details of the vase are eminently in keeping with them.</p>

<p>Engravings of some of Mr. Blashfield’s vases are given on Figs. <a href="#image434f">826 to 835</a>.
Of these, Fig. <a href="#image434f">827</a>, of novel design, bears powerful medallions of
Dante and Petrarch; and Fig. <a href="#image434f">828</a> (a flower-pot), those of the Queen and
the Prince Consort, and the Emperor and Empress of the French.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Bolingbroke.</h3>

<p>In the seventeenth century a pottery existed at Bolingbroke, in
Lincolnshire. Houghton, writing in 1693, speaks of “the blue clay of
Bolingbroke pottery, in Lincolnshire.” Nothing, however, is now known
as to this manufactory.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Wisbech.</h3>

<p>Terra-cotta of a remarkably good character, made from the clay of
the district, was made here in 1859; but the works were not of long
continuance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[439]</span></p>


<h3 class="smcap">Lowestoft and Gunton.</h3>

<p>Lowestoft, on the very easternmost point of England, on the coast of
Suffolk, is a pleasant town, with delightful sea views, a fine coast,
and a picturesque neighbourhood. It is an ancient borough; is divided
into three parts, respectively known as the “Old Town,” the “New Town,”
and the “Lower Town;” and its principal street, from which branch
off other streets to the left, and numberless “scores,” or narrow
ways, leading to the Dene and the sea, is about a mile in length,
and contains the principal residences, shops, and public buildings.
Its chief trade, like that of Yarmouth, is the herring fishery; and
many curious traditions of conflicts between the men of the two rival
“bloater towns” are still extant among the inhabitants. The principal
interest of the place, however, centres in the fact, that here, on one
of the easternmost points of the East Angles, a manufactory of fine
porcelain existed in the latter half of last century, and that genuine
productions of those works are now much sought for by collectors. In
1863 I visited Lowestoft for the special purpose of seeking information
regarding the works, about which at that time literally nothing was
known, and after a vast deal of research, both in the town and out of
it, I succeeded in obtaining the information which is embodied in this
chapter, and which, with the exception of its being now revised and
here and there amended, I contributed to the <i>Art-Journal</i> of July
in that year.</p>

<p>It seems somewhat strange that the absolute “land’s end” on the eastern
coast of England should have been chosen as the spot on which porcelain
should be made, when the clay for the purpose had to be procured from
the western “Land’s End,” Cornwall, and the coal from the extreme
northern coast of Northumberland and Durham. It is not improbable,
however, that the same cause which conduced to the establishment of the
Chelsea works had much to do with the formation of those at Lowestoft.
Certain it is that an extensive trade was in the early and middle
part of last century carried on, as it is at the present day, with
Holland; and certain it is, that at that time, as now, the town was the
constant resort of Dutch fishermen and others; and as the <i>first</i>
productions of the Ceramic Art in this neighbourhood appear, so far
as I have been able to ascertain, to have been delft-ware, it is not
too much to suppose that the first potters were from Holland, and made
the ware from clay found in the neighbourhood. Specimens of this fine
delft-ware,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[440]</span> inscribed with names of people in the neighbourhood, and
with dates, still exist, and attest pretty strongly to the correctness
of this opinion.</p>

<p>Gillingwater, in his “History of Lowestoft,” written in 1790, says at
p. 112:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The only manufactory carried on at Lowestoft is that of making
<i>porcelain, or china ware</i>; where the proprietors have
brought this ingenious art to a great degree of perfection;
and, from the prospect it affords, promises to be attended
with much success. The origin of this manufactory is as
follows:—In the year 1756, Hewlin Luson, Esq., of Gunton
Hall, near Lowestoft, having discovered some fine clay, or
earth, on his estate in that parish, sent a small quantity of
it to one of the china manufactories near London, in view of
discovering what kind of ware it was capable of producing,
which, upon trial, proved to be somewhat finer than that
called the delft-ware. Mr. Luson was so far encouraged by this
success as to resolve upon making another experiment of the
goodness of its quality upon his own premises; accordingly he
immediately procured some workmen from London, and erected
upon his estate at Gunton a temporary kiln and furnace, and
all the other apparatus necessary for the undertaking; but
the manufacturers in London being apprised of his intentions,
and of the excellent quality of the earth, and apprehending
also that if Mr. Luson succeeded he might rival them in their
manufacture, it induced them to exercise every art in their
power to render his scheme abortive; and so far tampered with
the workmen he had procured, that they spoiled the ware, and
thereby frustrated Mr. Luson’s design. But notwithstanding this
unhandsome treatment, the resolution of establishing a <i>china
manufactory at Lowestoft</i> was not relinquished, but was
revived again in the succeeding year (1757), by Messrs. Walker,
Brown, Aldred, and Rickman. This second attempt experienced
the same misfortune as the former one, and very nearly ruined
their designs; but the proprietors happening to discover these
practices of the workmen before it was too late, they took
such precautions as to render every future attempt of this
nature wholly ineffectual, and have now established the factory
upon such a permanent foundation as promises great success.
They have now enlarged their original plan, and by purchasing
several adjoining houses, and erecting additional buildings,
have made every necessary alteration requisite for the various
purposes of the manufactory. They employ a considerable number
of workmen, and supply with ware many of the principal towns
in the adjacent counties, and keep a warehouse in London to
execute the orders they receive both from the city and the
adjoining towns, and have brought the manufactory to such a
degree of perfection as promises to be a credit to the town,
useful to the inhabitants, and beneficial to themselves.”</p>
</div>

<p>It appears from this account that the first pottery was established
at Gunton, near Lowestoft, in 1756; but I am inclined to think that
pot making had been carried on some years before this date. Marryat
describes two plates in his possession, of coarse paste, with blue
borders, which bear, respectively, the words—</p>

<table class="sm">

</table>

<p class="p-left">which he considers may have been ante-dated; but the probability is
that they are not, but that they were painted at Gunton or Lowestoft
at the period whose date they bear. A remarkably fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[441]</span> blue and white
delft plate, or dish, which belonged to the late Mr. James Mills,
of Norwich, and traditionally said to be painted at Lowestoft, has
a bold border of blue colour round the rim, and the centre bears a
heart-shaped tablet (Fig. <a href="#image441">836</a>) with a Cupid at either side bearing a
pendent bunch of flowers. Above the tablet is a coronet, and below it
a knot and tassel. The tablet bears the words—<i>Robart &amp; Ann Parrish
in Norwich 1756.</i> Other examples of this kind of ware, bearing names
of individuals and places in the neighbourhood, have also come under my
notice, and tend to strengthen my opinion that they must have been made
somewhat prior to the year 1756.</p>

<p>It is a matter of extreme importance, and very noteworthy, that of the
<i>dated</i> examples of wares known or recorded, those of 1752, 1756,
1759, and 1760, are not china but delft ware; and that those from 1762
forward to 1789 are china. The inference is that the manufacture of
delft ware at Gunton or Lowestoft continued till about 1760, and that
about that time the manufacture of porcelain was gradually making its
way.</p>

<p>The proprietors of the porcelain works in 1757 are stated by
Gillingwater to be Messrs. Walker, Brown, Aldred, and Rickman. Of
some of these proprietors particulars will be found interwoven in
my present article, but of the others very little is known. By 1770
the manufacture had advanced very considerably, so much so that in
that year, as appears by the following advertisement, a warehouse
for its sale was established in London:—“Clark Durnford, Lowestoft
China Warehouse, No. 4, Great St. Thomas the Apostle, Queen Street,
Cheapside, London, where merchants and shopkeepers may be supplied with
any quantity of the said ware at the usual prices. N.B. Allowance of
Twenty per cent. for Ready Money.”</p>

<p>The firm was carried on (as is proved by the address furnished
to Mr. Duesbury, of the Derby China factory) under the style of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[442]</span>
“Robert Browne &amp; Co.”; the address is “Mr. Robt. Browne &amp; Co., China
Manufactory, Lowestoff, Suffolk.”</p>

  </div>

<p>One of the partners of the early firm, and the manager of the works,
was Robert Browne, who died in 1771, when the management fell to his
son, also Robert Browne, who, being an excellent practical chemist,
made great improvements in the ware. He was constantly experimenting on
“bodies,” and succeeded in bringing the art of making porcelain nearer
to the Oriental original than had been at that time attained by any
other individual. Of the first of these Robert Brownes an interesting
relic remains in the possession of his great-grandson at the present
day. It is a small inkstand, white, with blue ornaments. It is of
nine-sided form, and has Chinese figures on seven of its sides, the
other two being taken up with the pattern here engraved, the initials
“R. B., 1762,” being those of Robert Browne just alluded to.</p>

<p>The manufacture of porcelain under the management of the second Robert
Browne must have attained some great degree of excellence in 1775, for
in that year I find that a man named David Rhodes, who was apparently
employed by his master, Josiah Wedgwood, to collect together for him
examples of the productions of the different manufactories of this
country, enters in his account of expenses the purchase of a Lowestoft
slop basin, for which he gave ninepence. The account, which is in the
possession of Mr. Mayer, of Liverpool, is curious, as the following
items will show:—</p>

<p>Prices at which collectors nowadays would be only too glad to purchase
specimens. Fancy a quart Bristol mug, and a teapot-stand of the same,
for half-a-crown! and a Chelsea leaf, a Plymouth teapot, and two
Liverpool coffee-cups for sixpence!</p>

<p>The works must at this time have become noted, or they would not have
attracted the attention of Josiah Wedgwood, and made him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[443]</span> desirous of
examining the “body,” and comparing it with other wares made in this
country. That the china produced at and before this time was good
there can be no doubt, and the purchase of a “slop-basin” shows that
tea-services must, prior to that time, have been made. It would be
interesting to find that this identical slop-basin was still preserved
at Etruria, as, possibly, it may be, although I have failed to
recognise it.</p>

<p>A curious circumstance connected with the first Robert Browne, the
memory of which has been preserved in his family, is worth relating, as
showing the schemes and the underhand practices which were resorted to
by manufacturers in those days (as, alas! now), to worm out and steal
the secrets of others. The workmen who had been engaged from London
having been, as alluded to by Gillingwater, shamefully tampered with,
and bribed to injure the work at Lowestoft, probably induced Mr. Browne
to retaliate in the manner I am about to describe. Being desirous, soon
after the commencement of the works, to ascertain how the glaze was
prepared, some of the colours mixed, and other particulars concerning
the ingredients used, he went to London, and under the disguise of
a workman, engaged himself at one of the china manufactories—of
course either Chelsea or Bow. Here, after a short time, he bribed the
warehouseman to assist him in his design, and soon accomplished his
purpose. The warehouseman locked him up secretly in that part of the
factory where the principal was in the habit of mixing the ingredients
after the workmen had left the premises. Browne was placed under an
empty hogshead close to the counter or table on which the principal
operated, and could thus see through an opening all that was going on.
From his hiding-place he watched all the processes, saw the proportions
of the different ingredients used, and gained the secret he had so
long coveted. Having thus remained a willing prisoner for some hours,
he was at last released when the principal left the place, and shortly
afterwards returned to Lowestoft, after an absence of only two or
three weeks, in full possession of the, till then, secret information
possessed by the famed works of Chelsea or Bow.</p>

<p>It may be well to note that the Brownes, I am informed, were engaged
in the staple trade of the place—that of the herring fishery as
well as in that of the manufacture of porcelain. The firm also were
shipowners, and kept vessels constantly running “to the Isle of Wight
for a peculiar sand, which, with pulverised glass and pipeclay,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[444]</span> formed
principally the ingredients of the groundwork of the ware,” and to
Newcastle for coals.</p>

<p>Lowestoft is, fortunately, particularly rich in dated examples of
its productions; but it is worthy of remark, that the whole of these
examples, with names and dates, which have come under my notice, are
<i>white and blue</i>; showing that, during the period through which
these dates run, that was the character of the china made at these
works, and that the finer body and the elaborate colouring which
distinguish so much of the Lowestoft porcelain, were of later date. But
of this presently.</p>

<p>The earliest dated example of Lowestoft china ware I have yet seen is
the inkstand just described, which bears the initials “R. B.,” and
the date “1762.” In Mr. Norman’s collection was a bowl with the name
“<span class="smcap">Abrm. Moore</span>, 1765,” and a basin, said to have been made for
Sarah Crisp, has her initials “S. C., 1765.” The next is a fine bowl,
with a large group of Chinese figures—emperor, mandarins, &amp;c.—painted
in blue, and inscribed on the bottom with the name of an eccentric
old maid, well known in the town, and whose gravestone lies in the
churchyard:—</p>

<p class="center sm">ELIZA<sup>TH</sup> BUCKLE<br>
1768.</p>

<p>This bowl and other pieces of a service (notably a basin and cream
jug, painted with shepherd and shepherdess) made for her, were painted
by her nephew, a man named Robert Allen, who, as a boy, was one of
the first employed when the manufactory was established and remained
there until its close. The bowl is in the possession of his aged
daughter, Mrs. Johnson. This Robert Allen may well be classed amongst
the “worthies” of Lowestoft. Working at the china manufactory from the
first, he became foreman, and was entrusted with the mixing of the
colours and the ingredients of the material itself, and remained so
till the close of the factory in 1803. As a painter he appears to have
been chiefly employed on blue; at all events the only authenticated
specimens of his work which I have seen are of that colour. He also
employed himself in staining glass, and numerous pieces of his work are
still preserved by families in the town. His principal work was the
painting in the east window of the parish church, which he completed
in the year 1819, being then in his seventy-fourth year, and presented
it to the town. In acknowledgment of this service a silver cup, now in
possession of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[445]</span> his daughter, and bearing the following inscription,
was presented to him:—“A token of respect to Mr. Robert Allen, from
his fellow-townsmen at Lowestoft, for having, at the advanced age of
Seventy-four, gratuitously and elegantly ornamented the East Window of
their Parish Church Anno. Dom. 1819.”</p>

<p>After the closing of the Lowestoft works, Allen, who dealt in china,
&amp;c., put up a small kiln at his own house, where he carried on
operations on a limited scale, buying the unfinished ware from the
Rockingham works and painting and finishing it himself for sale. Mr.
Brameld, of the Rockingham works, who was an excellent painter on
china, occasionally visited Lowestoft, and became attached to Allen, to
whom he presented a set of five vases, beautifully painted from nature
with flowers copied from specimens he had gathered on the Dene. He also
presented him with a snuff-box, painted by himself.</p>

<p>Of the same year as the bowl above described (1768) a dated example in
the possession of Mr. Seago, the town clerk of Lowestoft, is a bowl,
with the words—</p>

<p class="center sm">EDWARD MORLEY<br>
1768</p>

<p class="p-left">Another bears the date—</p>

<p class="center sm">RICD. MASON<br>
JANY. 1TH<br>
1771</p>

<p class="p-left">Of this latter year another dated example is shown on the engraving
(Fig. <a href="#image445">838</a>); it has the words—“James &amp; Mary Curtis, Lowestoft, 1771.”
This mug was painted by Thomas Curtis, son of the pair named in the
inscription. He was for some time, it is said, employed at Dresden, and
became a “silent partner” in the Lowestoft works, and in his will is
described as a “porcelain painter.” Part of a set of china, painted by
this same Thomas Curtis on Oriental body, in 1775, and intended as a
wedding present for his son James, is still preserved in the family.</p>

     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center sm">Fig. 838.</p>
  </div>

<p>The next dated example of blue and white was in the museum of
the late Mr. Mills, of Norwich. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[446]</span> is a mug, and bears the
inscription—“<span class="allsmcap">ROBT. HAWARD 1781.</span>” The same gentleman had also
other initialed specimens, made originally for members of his family.
In Mr. Seago’s collection is an inkstand marked <i>S. A. Sept. 26
1782</i>, being the initials of Samuel Aldred; and Mr. Norman possessed
a similar inkstand inscribed “<i>A present from Lowestoft</i>,” but not
dated. In Norwich a later example, with the initials and date—</p>

<p class="center sm">W<br>
J&emsp;&emsp;S<br>
1784</p>

<p>is also preserved. A beautiful example, the <i>latest</i> known dated
specimen of Lowestoft china, is in the possession of Mr. J. Williams,
of Islington. It is a mug, three and a half inches high, painted in
blue with borders and flowers, and has on the front the initials and
name<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p class="center sm">G&ensp;C<br>
LOWESTOFT<br>
1789</p>

<p>These will be sufficient to show the range of years over which the
Lowestoft blue and white porcelain was manufactured. That it was made
to the close of the works there is every probability; but that it
gradually gave way to a finer and higher class of goods is certain.
Earthenware, too, of a fine kind, appears to have been made at
Lowestoft, of which I have seen some interesting examples, so called,
in various collections.</p>

<p>In the possession of Mr. Andreas A. Cockayne is a pair of remarkably
good salt-cellars of undoubted Lowestoft make. The inside is painted
with roses and other flowers, and the outside has festoons of roses and
foliage, and on either side of each is a shield bearing <i>gules</i>,
on a bend, <i>argent</i>, three leopards’ heads, caboshed, of the
field; over all an escutcheon of pretence with the arms of Cockayne,
<i>argent</i>, three cocks, <i>gules</i>. Crest, a leopard’s head,
caboshed, <i>gules</i>.</p>

<p>Before speaking of the later and higher class of goods made, or
painted, at Lowestoft, it is quite necessary to put collectors on
their guard against giving implicit credence to all they hear in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[447]</span>
locality as to the kinds of ware made at these works. I have seen
undoubted specimens of early Worcester, of Caughley, of Bristol, and
of several other localities, gravely asserted to be Lowestoft, and
even attempted to be proved to be such by the very marks they bear.
As a proof of this I may just mention that it is said the company did
a large trade with Turkey, and the ware prepared for that market “had
on it no representation of man or beast (so as not to offend Mahometan
law), and at the bottom of each piece the Crescent was painted!”
It is perhaps unnecessary to say that the pieces marked with the
“Turkish Crescent” are the ordinary blue and white with the Worcester
and Caughley marks, and that some of the pieces are the well-known
“cabbage-leaf” and other forms of those makes.</p>

<p>The great characteristic of the latter and more advanced porcelain
made at Lowestoft, is its extreme minuteness and intricacy of pattern
and beauty of finish. Indeed the decorations on many of the specimens
which I have examined, are of a character far superior, both in design
and in the exquisite and almost microscopic nicety of the pencilling
and finish, to those mostly produced at other English manufactories.
The borders are frequently very minute and elaborate, and the wreaths,
festoons, or groups of flowers, are equally delicate in their
proportions.</p>

<p>Some of the productions of the Lowestoft works are apparently painted
on Oriental body, but there are many good examples in existence where
the body is of Lowestoft make which are of very fine quality. The
collector will be able to distinguish immediately between the examples
painted at Lowestoft on Oriental body and those which were potted and
painted there. Punch-bowls and tea and coffee services appear to have
been the staple productions of these works, and, fortunately, many
of the former, and several almost complete sets of the latter, are
remaining in the hands of families in the neighbourhood, and in those
of local collectors, who seem imbued with a truly laudable desire
to keep alive the memory of what has been done for the Ceramic Art
in their town. The bowls are usually of remarkably good form, and
highly ornamented. They are mostly painted at Lowestoft, on Oriental
body. Some of these, though not dated, nevertheless give collateral
evidence of the period at which they were made, and become, therefore,
historically valuable; as do also, indeed, some of the services bearing
the initials, heraldic bearings, and monograms of families in the
neighbourhood. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[448]</span> punch-bowl in the possession of the town clerk of
Lowestoft, which is elaborately ornamented inside and out, bears inside
a well-painted representation of a fishing lugger at full sail, within
a circle, beneath which is the name of the vessel, <i>The Judas</i>.
This bowl was made for the boat <i>Judas</i>, and was filled with punch
and drank to its success before each fishing voyage, and at carousals
at their end. In the same collection is another beautiful bowl, bearing
on either side, within ovals, and surrounded by ornamental ovals, &amp;c.,
portraits of the notorious John Wilkes, and another, with the words
“Wilkes and Liberty.” The painting of these, as of all the higher class
of wares, is very beautiful and, indeed, in some parts exquisite.</p>

<p>When writing in 1863 upon these works (and it must be borne in mind
that I was the first to write upon them) I expressed myself as above.
My opinion that some of the Lowestoft productions were painted there on
Oriental body,—an opinion based upon thoroughly good foundation—has
been taken exception to by a later writer (who has been indebted for
nearly every scrap of information he has embodied in his work to what
I then wrote), in no measured terms. I was fortified in that opinion
by the judgment of the late Mr. Rose, of Coalport, than whom no man
living had a more thorough practical knowledge of bodies and of all
the different processes and phases of Ceramic Art, and whose opinion
in all technical matters was sought and relied upon by all scientific
men of real intelligence; and I am far from feeling disposed to give
up that opinion at the mere dictum of a dealer. I have hesitation in
saying that if a tithe of the pieces exhibited as Lowestoft <i>were</i>
painted there (which I very much doubt), they assuredly were painted
on Oriental body, for much of the ware now vaunted as Lowestoft is
certainly not English.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[449]</span></p>

<p>The coffee-pot (Fig. <a href="#image448">841</a>) formerly belonging to Mr. Norman is a good
specimen of Lowestoft painting. It forms part of a service, evidently
a marriage-service, originally made for Captain Walsh. The initials it
bears are probably those of himself and his bride. They are enclosed
in an oval within a wreath of roses and palm branches, tied with a
true lover’s knot. On either side is a Cupid, who supports a human
heart pierced with two arrows, and this is surmounted by a coronet. On
reference to the delft plate just described and engraved (Robert and
Ann Parrish), it will be seen how strongly the design of that early
example of Lowestoft earthenware accords with this, perhaps one of the
most highly finished of its productions in porcelain.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to describe other services, although many of them are
of the highest beauty. One tea service, with the crest (an owl) and
the monogram of W. W. conjoined, is especially deserving of notice,
however, as being one of the choicest examples of porcelain painting of
its kind which have come under my notice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[450]</span> This service, until lately
intact, has unfortunately been dispersed, and portions of it passed
into the collections of Sir Henry Tyrwhit, Mr. Norman, Mr. Seago, and
others.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that on much of the Lowestoft china the rose
is plentifully introduced. The reason for this is probably two-fold:
first, the arms of the borough is the Tudor (or full-blown) rose,
crowned with an open arched crown; and this may probably have been the
principal incentive in giving the rose so constant and so prominent
a place in the ornamentation of the china. Second, during the period
of the great Revolution, a French refugee of the name of Rose, one
of the cleverest of the French porcelain painters, found his way to
Lowestoft, and was engaged by the company. He became the principal,
and by far the best, of the artists employed, and probably introduced
the rose more generally, in allusion to his name, than would otherwise
have been done. To him may probably be ascribed the finest and most
minutely finished specimens of painting which the works produced, and
it was his taste which gave that French character to the general style
of ornamentation which is so discoverable on many of the services. It
is well to remark that on some of the pieces painted by him he is said
to have introduced a small rose under the handle as a special mark of
his work. Like that of many another man of genius, the lot of this
clever refugee artist was a sad one. He was an aged man when he came to
Lowestoft, and he remained at the works till his eyesight failed him,
and he became very poor. A subscription was entered into, and a couple
of donkeys to help him to carry water in the town purchased, and thus
he passed his last few years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[451]</span></p>

<p>In the group (Fig. <a href="#image450">842</a>), I have shown some very characteristic examples
of the higher class make of the Lowestoft works. The saucer is an
excellent specimen of floral decoration, and shows better than many the
rose which was so plentifully introduced in decoration. The painting,
however, of these bolder groups of flowers is not so good as in the
more minute ones—the artists, as I have before said, excelling in
minute, careful, and elaborate pencilling rather than in breadth of
style and colour. The coffee-cup is a simple but very good specimen
of heraldic decoration. It is part of a set made for the celebrated
writer, the Rev. Robert Potter, Prebendary of Norwich and Vicar of
Lowestoft, one of the most distinguished classical scholars of his
time, and chiefly known for his excellent translations of Æschylus,
Euripides, and Sophocles, and for other equally learned works. The
cup bears the arms <i>or</i>, a chevron, <i>sable</i>, between three
mullets, <i>gules</i>, pierced of the first; with crest, and motto,
“<span class="smcap">In Deo Potero</span>.” The tea-cup in the same group is a good
example of the not unusual French style of ornamentation, in wreaths,
monograms, and initials. The shield bears the initials “M.S.J.,” and is
surrounded by a remarkably elegant wreath of flowers, and surmounted
by a crest. The engraving (Fig. <a href="#image451">843</a>) is a simple <i>sketch</i> from
the saucer belonging to the cup just described, and is therefore not
filled in with the elaborate detail of the original. The mug engraved
in the group is of a form very usual in Lowestoft specimens. It is
well decorated with groups and sprays of flowers, among which the rose
is predominant. The borders on all these pieces are of elaborate and
minutely pencilled character.</p>

<p>Transfer printing on china does not seem to have been practised to
any extent at Lowestoft. One jug, however, which has been handed down
from father to son in the family of the most active proprietor, is
preserved, with a memorandum that the copper-plate from which it was
printed was given to Mr. Browne by a Mr. Gamble, of Bungay, who, with
his family, was in the habit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[452]</span> visiting Lowestoft. Probably the plate
was given that the family might be supplied with ware printed from it.
The design is a sportsman with dog and gun, and on the spout of the jug
are the letters ‘S. A.’ the initials of Samuel Aldred. I have also seen
a set of beakers, &amp;c., printed in blue, which are said to have been
bought at the factory, and to be attested as Lowestoft make.</p>

<p>The Lowestoft works did not excel in figures, which were usually
simple in design, and of small size. They are usually single rustic
figures, and possess no notable features; four examples, purchased
at the factory just before its close, are in the possession of Lady
Smith, and are highly interesting as being well authenticated. Among
the principal artists employed at the works were Rose, the refugee of
whom I have just spoken, whose beautiful floral patterns decorate most
of the best specimens of the ware of these works; Powles, a very clever
artist, whose name is well known as the draughtsman of the plates
illustrating Gillingwater’s “History of Lowestoft;” Allen, of whom I
have spoken, who painted the east window of the parish church, and was
the mixer of the colours at the factory; Redgate, who also was a good
flower-painter; Curtis, of whose productions I have already spoken;
Abel, John, and Joseph Bly; James, John, and Margaret Redgrave; and
others named Stevenson, Balls, Mottershed, and Simpson. Besides these,
several women were employed in painting and gilding.</p>

<p>The works were brought to a close in the year 1803 or 1804, and the
materials and finished goods were sold by auction. The causes which led
to their discontinuance were many, but principally the losses sustained
by the company, and the successful competition of the Staffordshire
manufacturers. One great loss was caused by the failure of their London
agents; another and more serious one by the destruction of a very large
quantity of Lowestoft china in Holland, with which country an extensive
trade was carried on, as thus stated:—“When Napoleon crossed the river
during a hard frost and captured Holland, amongst the British property
destroyed was a quantity of Lowestoft china at Rotterdam, in value
several thousand pounds.” The trade with Rotterdam was very large, and
the ware was sent weekly in hogsheads by way of Yarmouth. These two
losses, coming closely together, crippled the company; and the cost of
manufacture, through having no coal nor any other requisite material in
the neighbourhood, preventing them from producing ware so cheaply as
could be done in Staffordshire and at Derby and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[453]</span> Worcester, the works
were closed, after the proprietors had realised considerable sums; and
the town thus lost a branch of manufacture which was an honour to it,
and which has given it a name in the annals of the Ceramic Art of this
country.</p>

<p>And here, before proceeding further, let me again utter a word or two
of caution to collectors, against placing too implicit a reliance
upon what has been written concerning Lowestoft china, and against
taking for granted that all which is nowadays called Lowestoft china
is really the production of that manufactory. If all that is ascribed
to Lowestoft was ever made there, the works must have been about the
most extensive, and—if all the varieties of wares that are now said to
have been there produced were made, as is asserted, simultaneously—the
most extraordinary on record. The great bulk of the specimens now
unblushingly ascribed to Lowestoft I believe never were in that town,
much less were ever made there. Mr. Owen, in his excellent work on
Bristol china, says truly:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The fashion has become general to attribute all such
(Oriental) china to Lowestoft, in spite of the evidence
afforded by its make, texture, and glaze. It is painful to see,
in public and private collections, examples of Oriental ware
so labelled, simply because, though hard porcelain, they bear
English armorial coats and initials. Mrs. Wilton, of Twigworth
Villa, Gloucester, has a set of Oriental china mugs—with the
initials of her grandfather and grandmother—which were made
for her ancestor in China, and brought thence by himself.
According to the new fashion, these relics would be attributed
to Lowestoft. Many porcelain punch-bowls are to be found in
seaport towns with names and portraits of ships and very
early dates; these bowls are often attributed to the works at
Liverpool and Lowestoft. The officers of the East India Co.’s
ships were accustomed to take out English delft bowls, and get
them reproduced in common porcelain in China for their merchant
friends; and many a relic now prized as of home manufacture was
procured in this manner.”</p>
</div>

<p>And again:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If one hundredth portion only of the Oriental porcelain which,
on the slight evidence of having a certain red trellis-work in
the borders, or coarsely-painted roses, or English armorial
bearings, is erroneously attributed to <i>Lowestoft</i>, had
really been made there, that factory must have been the most
prolific and wonderful in the kingdom. A higher critical
appreciation of the peculiarities of Oriental ware would
prevent such an error.”</p>
</div>

<p>The mill for grinding the materials for the manufactory “was in a
ravine by the Warren House on Gunton Denes, where a fine stream of
water constantly flows. This was dammed up, and when it had arrived at
a certain height, was set to flow over a very large wheel (the largest
of the kind at that time in the kingdom), for the purpose of grinding
the materials for the china.” This water wheel is, I am informed, still
in existence. The factory was situated in the town, and the premises
are now occupied as a brewery. The street is still called Factory Lane.
It is worthy of note that no mark was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[454]</span> used upon Lowestoft china.
Marryat mentions a mark of three parallel straight blue lines; but this
is evidently an error, as no such examples appear to be known.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Stowmarket.</h3>

<p>The Tile Works at this place are of old establishment, and have always
been noted for the production of celebrated “white bricks,” spoken of
in the seventeenth century. They are worked by Mr. C. O. Fison, who, in
addition, manufactures an improved malt-kiln tile, both square-cluster
and round-cluster, for which honourable mention was made at the 1862
Exhibition. They are largely exported to various foreign countries, as
well as being extensively used in this kingdom.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Ipswich.</h3>

<p><i>Ransome’s Patent Stone.</i>—The first manufacture of this important
material was commenced at Ipswich in 1844; the inventor being Mr.
Frederick Ransome, of the firm of Ransomes and Sims of this town. The
works were removed in 1866 to East Greenwich, which see (page 162) for
a farther account.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Ebbisham.</h3>

<p>A large brick manufactory existed at Ebbisham, in Surrey, in the
seventeenth century, and a long and most interesting account of it,
and of the clays, as well as all the processes of manufacture, will be
found in Houghton’s “Husbandry and Trade Improved,” 1693.</p>

<p>A pottery was in existence here, in Kent, in the middle of the
seventeenth century, but nothing is known as to its history. The ware
was the usual coarse brown ware, of much the same character as the Toft
dishes. An example, formerly belonging to Mr. C. W. Reynolds, decorated
with an incised pattern and bearing the date 1668, and the initials
<span class="allsmcap">H. I.</span> and <span class="allsmcap">I. A.</span>, is traditionally said to be of this
make. In the British Museum is a large brown dish with the words <span class="allsmcap">E.
W. E., WROTHAM</span>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[455]</span> 1669, and in the Museum of Practical Geology is
a two-handled posset-pot with raised ornaments and inscription laid
on, in yellow slip, before glazing, <span class="allsmcap">T. E., WROTHAM</span>, 1703.
Another good example, belonging to Mr. Baldwin, is a four-handled tyg
ornamented with fleur-de-lis, &amp;c., and bearing the words
<img src="images/image455a.jpg" alt=""
style="height:1.5em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;"></p>

<p class="p-left">An interesting example, considered by Marryat to belong to Wrotham, is
given on Fig. <a href="#image454">844</a>.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Yarmouth.</h3>

<p>Although the name “Absolon, Yarmouth,” may occur on various pieces of
ware in different collections, it must not, for one moment, be taken
for granted that the pottery was produced there. The Absolons were
china and glass dealers in Yarmouth, and one of the family appears
to have erected a kiln, called the Ovens, and there to have burnt in
the flowers and other designs which he employed himself in painting
upon ware produced from other places. His plan appears to have been
to procure the ordinary cream-coloured ware in plates, &amp;c., and paint
upon them flowers in the manner of those of Swinton, Don, &amp;c.; and in
the same manner to write their names on the back; and then to burn them
in in his own “oven.” Mr. Norman possessed some plates of Absolon’s
painting, which bore on the back the usual mark of his name, pencilled
on and burnt in, and the name “<span class="allsmcap">TURNER</span>” impressed in the ware.
These pieces, there can be no reasonable doubt, were made by John
Turner, of Lane End. Mr. Chaffers says that having the name of “Turner”
stamped upon them, “proves that they were actually made at Caughley,
and decorated at Yarmouth;” but this carries its own condemnation on
the face of it, for Turner of Caughley is not known to have stamped his
<i>name</i> on his ware, and beyond this he did not produce cream ware
at his works. There is reason to believe that Absolon bought his ware
from Staffordshire and Leeds. He put his name in colour on the bottom
of the pieces he decorated.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Cossey.</h3>

<p>The works at Cossey, near Norwich, which now produce many art-works
of merit in the form of decorated bricks and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[456]</span> architectural
enrichments, were established about 1800, as a brick-yard, and so
continued of small size, until about 1827, when Cossey, or Costessy
Hall, the seat of its noble owner, Lord Stafford, was rebuilt, when
they were enlarged, so as to enable a full supply for the purpose to
be made. The foreman of these works was Mr. Gunton, and under his care
the manufacture of ornamental bricks, for the new hall, was tried, and
with marked success. On this hall,—one of the best of brick buildings,
and one which may be looked upon as a gigantic example of Cossey
ceramic art—are some remarkably fine Tudoresque chimney shafts, as
well as excellently designed and well-executed cusped window-heads,
transoms, mullions, &amp;c.; and finials, door-jambs, cornices, panelling,
and string-courses, all of equal excellence. These are all formed
of moulded brick made at Cossey from native clays, and are still in
remarkably good preservation. After the completion of the building of
the Hall the brickworks were closed for about four years, when Mr.
Gunton succeeded in renting them in the hope of fully carrying out his
idea of manufacturing decorated brickwork. Unfortunately, however,
he was not permitted to have the use of the moulds from which the
Hall bricks had been made; but, nevertheless, he from time to time
prepared new moulds for chimney shafts, window-heads, mouldings, &amp;c.,
and gradually got them into notice, and architects and builders soon
began to see their advantage. The works are now carried on by his
son, Mr. George Gunton, whose productions are of the highest possible
class of merit. Among the architectural enrichments produced at these
works,—the designs being entirely supplied by architects, and of the
purest style and finish—are chimney shafts, many of which are of the
most elaborate style of ornamentation; window-heads, &amp;c.; balustrades;
cornices; medallions; crest-ridging; string-courses; plinths; arches
and keys; pateræ; architraves; finials; capitals, bases, and shafts;
and many other matters. These are produced of remarkable sharpness and
of great beauty of finish—the tooth, nail-head, and other ornaments,
being very pure in character. They are produced in two colours—a fine,
rich, deep red, and a stone; the latter being the nearest approach of
any to artificial stone, and both being extremely hard and durable.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Cadborough.</h3>

<p>The <i>Cadborough Pottery</i>, near Rye, in Sussex, was first built
about 1807, and carried on by Mr. James Smith, and afterwards by
his son,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[457]</span> Mr. Jeremiah Smith. In 1840, the business passed into the
hands of the late Mr. William Mitchell (who had had the management of
it, under Mr. Smith, since 1827), who carried it on in his own name
until 1859, when he took one of his sons, Mr. Frederick Mitchell,
into partnership, and the firm became “Wm. Mitchell &amp; Son,” and so
continued until 1869, when the partnership was dissolved, under mutual
arrangement, Mr. Mitchell, sen., continuing the Cadborough business
for common earthenware, and his son, Mr. Frederick Mitchell, taking
the fancy department, which was his own creation, to new premises, the
Bellevue Pottery (which see). In 1870, Mr. Mitchell, sen., died, and
the business at Cadborough was then taken by Mr. Henry Mitchell, who
still carries it on. The goods produced are the ordinary common brown
wares, glazed and unglazed, and consist of flower-pots; chimney-pots;
pitchers and crocks of various kinds; tongue, ham, beef, biscuit, milk,
and other pans; bottles, jugs, bowls, and other domestic vessels; sewer
and drain pipes; butter-pots; and all the other usual articles made in
this ware. The clay is dug on the farm of Cadborough, as is also the
loam with which it is mixed, and it is of peculiarly hard and durable
texture, and capable of taking a good glaze. Many of the domestic
vessels are mottled or “splashed” under the glaze.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Rye.</h3>

<p>The “<i>Bellevue Pottery</i>” in the Ferry Road, Rye, Sussex, was
established in 1869, by its present proprietor, Mr. Frederick Mitchell,
son and partner of the late Mr. William Mitchell of the Cadborough
Pottery (which see). It was established entirely for the manufacture
of “Sussex Rustic Ware”—an ornamental branch of the brown-ware goods
invented by Mr. Frederick Mitchell while at those works. This ware is
of peculiar, but highly pleasing character, and in it a large variety
of fancy articles, flower-baskets, candlesticks, jugs, vases, pilgrims’
bottles, &amp;c., are made. The clay is peculiarly light, and of tolerably
close texture, and it is capable of working into any form. The glaze,
which is of equal richness with that of “Rockingham” ware, is of
exceedingly good quality, and it has a rich effect over the mottling or
“splashing” which characterizes this ware. Many of the productions are
very artistic, and evince much taste and skill in manipulation. Some of
the vessels are decorated with the leaf and head of the staple product
of the county<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[458]</span> —the hop—or with other excellent copies of leaves
and flowers, &amp;c. The peculiarity of this “Sussex Rustic Ware” is its
extreme lightness, and the richness of its mottling and glaze.</p>

<p>One article, worthy of especial notice, as made at these works (and
formerly at Cadborough), is the “Sussex Pig” here engraved. This is a
drinking vessel of the same general character as the “Bears,” which
will be found described under the heads of Brampton, Nottingham,
&amp;c. The body, when filled with ale, stands on end, on its tail, and
the head lifts off to be used as a drinking cup, precisely in the
same manner as with the “bears.” In Sussex these “pigs” are used at
weddings, when each guest is invited to “drink a <i>hogshead</i> of
beer to the health of the bride;” and at other social and convivial
meetings. On these occasions each person is expected to drink this
cup—or “hog’s head”—full of liquor.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Gestingthorpe.</h3>

<p>Pavement tiles and other articles were made at Gestingthorpe, in Essex,
in the seventeenth century. Houghton, writing in 1693, says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“From my ingenious good friend, <i>Mr. Samuel Dale</i>, of
<i>Braintree</i>, in <i>Essex</i>, I am informed, that at
<i>Gestingthorpe</i>, in that county, are made a sort of hard
yellowish bricks and pavements, called <i>white brick</i>, and
<i>Walpet brick</i>, from a town in <i>Suffolk</i> of that
name, where they were first made; they are harder and more
durable than common red brick, and therefore much used for
pavement of floors in lower rooms, and also for fire-hearths,
except just where they make their fires.”</p>
</div>


<h3 class="smcap">Holkham.</h3>

<p>In 1849, the Earl of Leicester, anxious to turn the clays of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[459]</span>

terra-cotta at Holkham, and produced some good Tudor chimney-tops and
moulded bricks.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Nuneham Courtney.</h3>

<p>Potworks existed here in the beginning of the seventeenth century, and

<h3><span class="smcap">York.</span></h3>

<p>“<i>Place’s Ware.</i>”—Francis Place, who may be looked upon as one of
the pioneers of modern pottery, commenced the manufacture of what, at
the time, was considered “equal to true china ware,” about 1665. But
little, however, is known either of the manufactory, or of the ware he
produced. Francis Place was, according to Walpole, a younger son of Mr.
Rowland Place, of Dimsdale, in the county of Durham, and was placed as
clerk to an attorney in London until 1665. Walpole’s notice of him runs
thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Francis Place, a gentleman of Yorkshire, had a turn
to most of the beautiful arts. He painted, designed, and
etched. Mr. Scots of Crown Court, Westminster, had a picture
of gooseberries painted in oil on a black ground (a common
method with him, as Mr. Scots was told by Mrs. Wyndham,
Place’s daughter, who was living in 1764), and a jug of his
Earthenware. Mr. Place was placed as clerk to an attorney in
London, where he continued till 1665, in which year going
into a shop the officers came to shut up the house, on its
having the Plague in it. This occasioned his leaving London,
and gave him an opportunity of quitting a profession that was
contrary to his inclination, and of following the roving life
he loved and the arts for which he had talents. Ralph Thoresby
often mentions Mr. Place with great encomiums and specifies
various presents that he made to his Museum. He tells us too
that Mr. Place discovered an earth for, and a method of making
Porcelain, which he put in practice at the Manor house at York,
of which manufacture he gave Thoresby a fine Mug. His pottery
cost him much money; he attempted it solely from a turn for
experiments, but one Clifton took the hint from him, and made a
fortune by it.”</p>
</div>

<p>Thoresby, in his “Ducatus Leodiensis” (1714), mentions Place and his
wares several times. The principal notice, when speaking of the vein of
white clay in the hundred of Wortley, is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Here is a good vein of fine clay that will retain its
whiteness after it is burnt (when others turn red), and
therefore used for the making of tobacco pipes, a manufacture
but lately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[461]</span> begun at Leeds. Of the several sorts of clay, their
nature and colours, and how to manage such as are stubborn,
my honoured friend, John Evelyn, Esq., has writ incomparably
in his Sylva and Pomona; and there is a very curious table of
clay exhibited by another celebrated naturalist of this age.
As to the sort and manner of making Pipes, I can add nothing
to what my late friend, M<sup>r</sup> Houghton, has writ in his useful
collections, where he tells us also that the finest mugs, and
even China ware, are made of this sort of Earth, of which,
saith he, we may make as good in England as any in the world,
and this I am fully convinced of, having a specimen in this
Museum made of English materials in the Manor house at York by
the very ingenious M<sup>r</sup> Francis Place, who presented it to me
with one of the outer covers purposely made to secure them from
the violence of the fire in baking.”</p>
</div>

<p>From the examples at present in existence—and there are only two or
three known—it appears that the ware was simply a tolerably fine kind
of earthenware, of a greyish colour streaked with black and brown; and
this is the way in which Horace Walpole describes his specimen: “I have
a coffee cup of his ware; it is of grey earth, with streaks of black,
and not superior to common earthenware.” This example was sold at the
Strawberry Hill sale, and passed into the hands of Mr. Franks, who
generously presented it to the Museum of Practical Geology. It is a cup
about 2½ inches in height, and 2⅛ inches in diameter at the top. It is
of thin glazed greyish ware, streaked with black and brown, and has a
narrow rib, or raised band, running round it at about two-thirds of its
height from the top. An old pasteboard label attached to the handle of
this cup bears the words “Mr. Francis Place’s china,” probably in the
handwriting of Horace Walpole.</p>

<p>Examples are also in the hands of some of the descendants of Mr. Place.
They are of precisely the same character as the one just described.
In the same hands is “a small portrait of Place, by himself, in
which he has introduced one of his cups, the original of which his
descendant possesses, and which is traditionally said to be one which
he considered to be his masterpiece.” Mr. Place, in 1712, visited
Thoresby, and in 1728 he died, leaving a widow and an only child, a
daughter, married to Wadham Wyndham, Esq.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>York China Manufactory.</i>—In 1838 Mr. Haigh Hirstwood, formerly
of the Rockingham china works, established a china manufactory in York,
and by the succeeding spring had so far progressed that the following
paragraph appeared in one of the York papers:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">York China Manufactory.</span>—Mr. Hirstwood, of Stonegate,
is erecting a kiln, extensive warehouses, &amp;c., in the Groves,
for manufacturing, gilding, and burnishing china, which has not
previously been attempted in this city.”</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">The works were established in Lowther Street, Groves,
and were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[462]</span> continued until about 1850, when the concern was wound up.
Mr. Haigh Hirstwood was born at Royd’s Hall, near Huddersfield, in
1778; and learnt the art of china making and decorating under the
Bramelds at the Rockingham works, as did also afterwards his sons and
son-in-law. He continued at the Rockingham works upwards of forty
years, leaving them only towards their close, when he removed to York
and commenced business as a china dealer. In 1839, as I have stated, he
erected kilns, &amp;c., at York, and commenced business in the decorating
and finishing departments, buying his china in the white from Sampson
Bridgwood &amp; Co. of Longton, and from others. In this business he
was assisted by his son-in-law, Mr. William Leyland also from the
Rockingham works, who became his managing partner. Disagreements having
arisen, however, the business was broken up, Mr. Hirstwood remaining
in York, where he died in 1854, and Mr. Leyland removing to London,
when he took to painting and decorating lamps, where he died in 1853,
leaving a widow (who soon afterwards died) and a family of two sons and
four daughters, who are now of Lawrence, near Boston, Massachusetts,
North America. Mr. Leyland was a clever painter, gilder, and enameller,
and understood well all the practical details of the potter’s art. Mr.
Hirstwood was a clever painter of flowers, &amp;c., and was considered the
best fly painter at the Rockingham works. In 1826 he copied, for use
in the decoration of the Rockingham china, upwards of five hundred
insects at Wentworth House, which had been arranged by Lady Milton, the
daughter-in-law of Earl Fitzwilliam. He and his sons Joseph and William
(who were brought up at the Rockingham works) were engaged upon the
<i>chef-d’œuvres</i> of that manufactory, the services for King William
IV. and for the Duchess of Cumberland. He was succeeded in his business
in Coney Street by his son, Mr. William Hirstwood, father of the
present proprietor, but the manufactory has been entirely discontinued
since 1850. No mark was used.</p>

<p>The goods principally produced were dinner, tea, dessert, and other
services, vases, figures, &amp;c. The style of decoration was, as is
natural to expect, closely assimilated to that of Rockingham china;
indeed, so closely as in some instances scarcely to be distinguished
from them. Some of the flowers are beautifully painted, as are also the
butterflies and other natural objects, and the gilding is remarkably
good. The figures are usually of good character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[463]</span></p>


<h3 class="smcap">Layerthorpe Pottery.</h3>

<p>This manufactory of coarse ware—flower-pots, chimney pipes, bowls,
socket pipes, &amp;c.—was established in 1846 by its present proprietor,
Mr. John Webster, who produces considerable quantities of ware.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Osmotherley.</h3>

<p>A pottery, discontinued many years back, existed at this place.
Its productions were the ordinary brown ware, in which jugs, mugs,
pitchers, tobacco-boxes, &amp;c., were produced.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Hull.</h3>

<p>There can be no doubt but that common earthenware was made at Hull, if
not earlier, at all events in the middle of the seventeenth century;
but no record of such works has at present been brought to light. In
June, 1875, however, some property at Sculcoates, formerly an outskirt
of Hull, was brought to the hammer by Mr. Charles Johnson. It was in
extent about one-third of an acre, and has always been known by the
name “Pot House Yard.” Inquiries have resulted in ascertaining that
this pottery at Sculcoates had not been worked in the memory of those
living, but that there were pottery works there. There are still
remaining three cottages fronting into the ground, of a date certainly
a hundred and fifty years back, but more probably two hundred years.
Part of the site has been occupied in recent years by Messrs. Stewart
and Gregson, oil refiners, who have now become the purchasers of the
whole of the property. Very early in the eighteenth century pipe-making
was carried on here; and Gent, in his curious history, published in
1735, records, among the epitaphs in the churchyard, one to “Thomas
Cook, Pipe-maker, who died the 7th of February, 1720, aged 64.” The
first distinct information I have been able to gather regarding pot
works at this place is that in 1802 (eighteen years earlier than the
first date given by Chaffers), by a deed, dated August 10 in that
year, Thomas English, of Hull, merchant, sold a plot of land on what
is called the Humber Bank, in a part of what was then the outskirts of
the town, and known as “Myton.” The piece of land consisted of 3,718
square yards, and was conveyed to James Smith and Jeremiah Smith, both
of Hull, potters; Job Ridgway, of Shelton, Staffordshire, potter; and
Josiah Hipwood, of Hull, blockmaker.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[464]</span> That part of the town has for
fifty years, to the writer’s knowledge, been known as the “Pottery,”
a name doubtless derived from these works. The deed of partnership
between these parties was dated 23rd November, 1802.</p>

<p>From the fact of two of the parties, James Smith and Jeremiah Smith,
being described as “of Hull, potters,” while Job Ridgway was of
“Shelton, Staffordshire, potter,” the probability is that the Smiths
were already in business there as pot-makers, and that Ridgway joined
them for the purpose of increasing and improving their manufacture.
The partnership, however, was but of short duration, for in 1804
Mr. Ridgway, being desirous of retiring, agreed to sell to the
remaining partners all his <i>fourth</i> part of the lands, works,
stock-in-trade, debts, &amp;c., for the sum of £1,000. Hipwood left the
concern in the same year, when a Mr. James Rose became a partner with
the Smiths. In 1806 the proprietors assigned all their interest in the
works to Messrs. Job and George Ridgway, who carried them on for some
years. In 1826 they were succeeded by Mr. William Bell, who became
the proprietor in that year, by deed of conveyance from the brothers
Ridgway. By Mr. Bell the manufactory was very much extended, and the
operations were carried on on a large scale, chiefly for export, the
principal part of the trade being with Hamburg, where his brother, Mr.
Edward Bell, was in business, and a large German and Dutch trade was
done through his means. The works were closed in 1841, when the plant
and stock were disposed of by auction, as here shown:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To Potters, &amp;c. To be Sold by Auction, by Mr. Stamp, at the
Belle Vue Pottery, Humber Bank, Hull, on Thursday, July 29th,
1841, at Eleven o’Clock, without Reserve, the Remainder of the
Utensils and Stock, consisting of four Printing Presses, 60
large Copper Plates, large Iron Mortar and Pestle, large Scale
Beam, Boards, and Weights; several small Lots of Tincal, Borax,
Colours, &amp;c.; sundry Boards, Planks, Tubs, Shovels, Whirlers,
Rakes, Lumber, &amp;c. A Kiln of Unfinished Pots; a great Quantity
of Moulds, Saggars, &amp;c.; three good Counting-house Desks,
Writing Table, Nest of Drawers, Shelves, and other Office
Furniture. The above may be seen one Day previous to the Sale,
on application to the Auctioneer.”</p>
</div>

<p>At this sale Mr. Charles Johnson, of Hull, to whom I am indebted for
much of this information, acted as auctioneer for Mr. Stamp, and I am
informed by him that the copper-plates, the stock of which weighed
about three hundredweight, and amongst which were some of the “Willow
pattern,” “were sold to a pottery works at or near Rotherham,” which I
presume to be either the Swinton or the Don works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[465]</span></p>

<p>The wares produced were cream-coloured ware, green-glazed ware, the
ordinary white ware, and blue printed wares; and in them the usual
classes of useful goods, consisting of services of various kinds and
miscellaneous articles, were made. One notable dinner-service was made
to commemorate an exploit in connection with the noted pirate Paul
Jones, and was, it would appear, made for the owner, or family of the
owner of the “Crow Isle.” Only one plate of this service is now known
to be in existence, and this is preserved at the Hull Museum, to which
it was presented by the late Mr. Charles Hassell, grandson to the late
Francis Hall, Esq., of Hull, who was owner of the “Crow Isle,” Baltic
trader. In the centre is represented the “Crow Isle” successfully
beating off Paul Jones on its homeward voyage when off the Yorkshire
coast in 1779. Another example of the Belle Vue pottery is a butter-pot
in form of a cow, with movable lid, in yellow ware. Mr. Johnson has
also in his possession a portion of a remarkably fine green-glazed
dessert service, of very artistic design, in embossed leaves, with
basket-work centres to the plates, which was bought at the Hull works
from Mr. Bell in 1838. It is marked with the impressed mark (Fig. <a href="#image455b">845</a>).</p>

<p>The mark is the one here engraved. It is two bells, surrounded by the
words “<span class="smcap">Belle Vue Pottery, Hull</span>;” but sometimes the bells
alone appear, without the lettering. In the possession of the late Mr.
Bagshawe were some of the later accounts of these works, from which a
good idea of the extent to which the operations were carried on may
be gleaned. For instance, in 1837, four years before the close of the
works, the expenses were as under:—</p>

<p>The works have been entirely discontinued since 1841, and the site
included in the extensive engineering works of Messrs. C. D. Holmes &amp;
Co.</p>

<p>In 1804, Mr. William Clowes (also from the Staffordshire pottery
district), one of the founders of Primitive Methodism, worked at the
Hull pottery. Mr. Clowes was born at Burslem in 1780; he “came from
Nottingham to Hull to establish a missionary centre, on the 15th of
January, 1819;” the day after his arrival “he informs us that he
visited the Pottery by the Humber Bankside, where he had worked as a
potter fifteen years before, but he found the working of the pottery
had been discontinued;” <i>i.e.</i>, I presume it was then in a
transition state before being transferred to Mr. Bell by the brothers
Ridgway.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Stepney Lane.</i>—At the present time a small pottery for the
manufacture of the common brown ware pancheons, flower-pots, &amp;c., is
still carried on by the successors of Mr. Mayfield, of the Stepney
Paper Mills, Hull.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Leeds.</h3>

<p>There is no doubt that pottery has been made at Leeds, or in its
immediate neighbourhood, from the earliest times of our British
history. Celtic and Romano-British relics have, from time to time,
been found in the neighbourhood, which were, without doubt, made at
the place; and the village of Potters Newton evidently takes its name
from a colony of potters having settled there in early times. That it
<i>was</i> so in days of yore is evidenced by the fact of the name
appearing in deeds of the thirteenth century. In later times coarse
brown earthenware was made in Leeds, as were also tobacco-pipes in the
reign of Charles II. These were made from clays found at Wortley—the
same bed of clay which was worked for the old Leeds pottery, and is
still used for making yellow ware and saggars at the present day.
The manufacture of tobacco-pipes at Leeds was established in the
latter part of the seventeenth century, and was carried on somewhat
extensively for several years. Ralph Thoresby, in his “Ducatus
Leodiensis,” published in 1714, in his account of Wortley Hundred says:
“Here is a good vein of fine clay, that will retain its whiteness after
it is burnt (when others turn red), and therefore used for the making
of tobacco-pipes, a manufacture but lately begun at Leeds.” Probably
to the existence of this bed of fine clay is to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[467]</span> attributed the
establishment of the pot works at Leeds, to which I am now about to
direct attention.</p>

<p>Of the date of the first establishment of the Leeds pot works nothing
definite is known. It is, however, certain that they were in existence
about the middle of last century, and that they were then producing
wares of no ordinary degree of excellence. Before this time a kind
of delft-ware was made, and I have seen some very creditable copies
of Oriental patterns, with salt glaze, also produced at these works.
Delft-ware, however, was only made to a small extent, and was soon
succeeded by the manufacture of that fine cream-coloured earthenware
which made the works so famous, and enabled them in that particular
branch to compete successfully with Wedgwood and other makers. As
early as 1770 considerable progress had been made in the ornamental
productions, and I have seen dated examples of open and embossed
basket-work ware of a few years later (1777 and 1779), which are as
fine as anything produced at the time.</p>

<p>The first proprietors of whom there appears to be any record were
two brothers named Green, in 1760; and it is believed their earliest
productions were in black ware, in which the firm afterwards excelled.
It was then carried on by Humble, Green, &amp; Co. “Mr. Wilson has found
the draft of an agreement, dated November 11, 1775, whereby ‘Joshua
Green, of Middleton, gent., John Green, of Hunslet, potter, with divers
others, under the firm of Humble, Green &amp; Co.,’ agree with Messrs.
Hutchinson and Evers to erect and maintain in repair at their mill a
water-wheel, with all necessary machinery for grinding flints. For
thirteen years the wheel was to be used exclusively by the Greens, who
were to supply burnt flints and to pay 10s. for every 100 pecks of well
ground and levigated flints, the workmen’s wages being first deducted.”
In 1783 the firm was Hartley, Greens, &amp; Company, and they had so far
advanced in their work, and were so firmly established and well known
by that year as to justify them in issuing a book of “designs” of
some of the articles they were then producing. A copy of this rare
volume, in my own possession, contains all three of the lists—English,
French, and German. The English title is “Designs of sundry Articles
of Queen’s, or Cream-colour’d Earthen-Ware, manufactured by Hartley,
Greens, &amp; Co., at Leeds-Pottery: with A Great Variety of other
Articles. The same Enamel’d, Printed or Ornamented with Gold to any
Pattern; also with Coats of Arms, Cyphers, Landscapes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[468]</span> &amp;c., &amp;c. Leeds,
1783.” The list and title-page occupy eight pages, as do also each of
the two others—translated into German and French—which accompany
it, and which bear the following titles:—“Abrisse von verschiedenen
Artickeln vom Königinnen oder gelben Stein-Gute, welches Hartley,
Greens, &amp; Comp. In ihrer Fabrick in Leeds verfertigen; Nebst vielen
andern Artickeln; Auch dieselben gemahlt, gedruckt oder mit Gold
gezieret zu jedem Muster, ebenfalls mit Wapen, eingegrabene Namen,
Landschaften, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Leeds, 1783.” “Desseins de divers Articles
de Poteries de la Reine en Couleur de Creme, Fabriqués à la Poterie de
Hartley, Greens, &amp; Co. à Leeds: Avec une Quantité d’autres Articles;
Les mêmes émaillés, imprimés ou ornés d’Or à chaque Patron, aussi avec
des Armes, des Chiffres, des Paisages, &amp;c. &amp;c. Leeds, 1783.”<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
This catalogue, with some variations, continued to be issued till a
much later period. A copy presented by myself in 1865 to the Jermyn
Street Museum supplies the plates missing in the former copy. It has
no title-page, but is printed on paper bearing a water-mark of 1814.
The words “Leeds Pottery” are engraved on each plate of the book. The
plates, forty-four in number, are very effectively engraved on copper,
and exhibit a wonderful, and certainly exquisite, variety of designs
for almost all articles in use, both plain, ornamented, perforated, and
basket-work, including services, vases, candlesticks, flower-stands,
inkstands, baskets, spoons, &amp;c., &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[469]</span></p>

<p>The partners at this time (1783–4) composing the firm of Hartley,
Greens, &amp; Co. were William Hartley, Joshua Green, John Green, Henry
Ackroyd,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> John Barwick, Samuel Wainwright, Thomas Wainwright,
George Hanson, and Saville Green. The business was, it appears, divided
into six shares, of which William Hartley, Joshua and John Green, and
Henry Ackroyd, had each one; John Barwick and the two Wainwrights half
of one each; and George Hanson and Saville Green a quarter share each,
the latter acting as “bookkeeper” to the firm. The proprietors were
extremely systematic and particular in their mode of keeping accounts
and in their dealings with each other. They held regular meetings, and
appointed independent and disinterested persons as valuers in each
department; for instance, one to value the stock of finished goods in
the ware rooms, another the unfinished ware, another the copper plates,
another the buildings, others the moulds and models, the windmill,
the horses, the waggons and carts, the raw materials, the woodwork,
and every imaginable thing. The reports of these various valuers,
whose names and awards for many years I have carefully examined, were
submitted to a meeting of the partners, when a balance was struck, to
which the names of each one were attached.</p>

<p>In 1785, and again in 1786, fresh editions of the catalogue and book
of plates were issued, without change either in the number of articles
enumerated or in their variety or form. The works at this time had
been considerably increased in size, and the wares made were exported
in large quantities to Germany, Holland, France, Spain, and Russia.
So great had the concern become five years later (1791), that the
yearly balance then struck amounted to over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[470]</span> £51,500; and it is worth
recording that in that year the value of the copper-plates from which
the transfer printing was effected was £204, while at the present time
they represent about £1,000. These copper-plates consisted of teapot
borders, landscapes, Nankin borders, and others. The general stock in
this year (1791) was valued at about £6,000, and the windmill at about
£1,200. The house of the partners, entered as “Hartley, Green, &amp; Co.’s
House,” was at Thorpe Arch, near Tadcaster and Wetherby.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> At Thorpe
Arch, too, were the grinding mills. These mills were ten miles from
the works at Leeds, and a team of four horses was kept constantly at
work carrying the ground flint and stone. They, with the men who worked
them, stayed six days, going and coming, between the two places, and
then six at Thorpe Arch, alternately. The raw material was taken from
Leeds to the mills at Thorpe Arch, when the horses who had brought it
worked the mill to grind it, and returned with it, when prepared, to
Leeds for use. This continued until 1814, when the windmill on the
Leeds premises, which had been used as a corn mill, was converted
into a flint mill, and an engine, made by the builders of the first
successful locomotive, Fenton, Murray, &amp; Co., put up. This mill is
still used for the same purpose.</p>

<p>In 1794 another edition of the catalogue and pattern-book was issued.
It was precisely the same in contents as the previous editions, both
in the plates and letter-press; and contained the catalogue, or list,
in English, French, and German. Fresh designs appear to have been
continually added, and, the connections of the company increasing,
a translation of the catalogue into the Spanish language was in a
few years issued. This interesting work, of which a copy is in the
possession of Mr. E. Hailstone, F.S.A., and which also contains the
English catalogue, without date, bears the following title:—“Dibuxos
de varios Renglones de Loza Inglesa de Regna, de Color de Crema,
Fabricados en la Manufactura y Lozeria Hartley, Greens, y Comp<sup>a</sup>. en
Leeds: en este mismo ramo fabriam de dicha loza, hay piezas esmaltadas,
impresas y adornadas con oro; como tambien hermoseadas con escudos,
armas, cifras, payses, &amp;c. &amp;c. Leeds.” Instead of 152 general articles,
as enumerated in the previous editions, 221 appear in this; and instead
of 32 in tea-ware, 48 appear. In 1814, too, another edition was issued,
a copy of which is in my own possession; it contains 71 plates of
patterns, exhibiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[471]</span> 221 general articles, and 48 patterns of tea,
coffee, and chocolate services. In this edition the whole of the
plates, both those from the other copies and those newly engraved, have
the words “Leeds Pottery” engraved upon them.</p>

<p>In the middle of the last century an important event in connection
with the Leeds pottery took place. This was the establishment of the
tramway from the collieries of Mr. Charles Brandling, at Middleton, to
the town of Leeds. This tramway passed through the Leeds pot works, to
the proprietors of which a nominal rental of £7 a year was paid, and to
whom, as a further consideration for the right of passage, an advantage
in the price of coals was allowed.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> While speaking of the formation
of this early line, it is interesting to note that upon it was set to
work the first locomotive commercially successful on any railway. Mr.
John Blenkinsop, who was manager of the Middleton Collieries, took
out a patent, in 1811, for a locomotive steam engine, and placed his
designs for execution in the hands of Messrs. Fenton, Murray &amp; Co., at
that time eminent engineers of Leeds. This was the first locomotive
engine in which <i>two cylinders</i> were employed, and in that
respect was a great improvement upon those of Trevithick and others.
The cylinders were placed vertically, and were immersed for more than
half their length in the steam space of the boiler. The progress was
effected by a cog wheel working into a rack on the side of one of the
rails. Mr. Blenkinsop’s engine began running on the railway extending
from the Middleton Collieries to the town of Leeds, a distance of about
three miles and a half, on the 12th of August, 1812, two years before
George Stephenson started his first locomotive. Mr. Blenkinsop was for
many years principal agent to the Brandling family, and his invention
was, as is seen, first brought to bear in bringing coals from those
pits to Leeds—a matter of immense importance to the town and its
manufactures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[472]</span></p>

<p>In 1796, as named in Hutchins’ “History of Dorset,” much of the Poole
clay in that county was sent “to Selby for the use of the Leeds
potteries.”</p>

<p>In the year 1800 two fresh partners, Ebenezer Green and E. Parsons,
had joined the concern, the firm at this time consisting of William
Hartley, Joshua Green, John Green, Ebenezer Green, E. Parsons, Mrs.
Ackroyd and her daughter Mary (widow and daughter of Henry Ackroyd,
deceased), John Barwick, Thomas Wainwright, George Hanson, Saville
Green, and Samuel Wainwright. On the death of Mr. Hartley the business
was carried on—still under the title of Hartley, Greens &amp; Co.—by the
remaining partners; and a Mr. Ruperti, a Russian, became, I believe,
a partner in the firm. The trade at this time was, as I have already
stated, principally with Russia, and with Norway, Spain and Portugal,
and hence, I presume, Mr. Ruperti’s connection with it. The agent in
Russia at one time was Mr. Barwick, and afterwards his nephew, Mr.
Jubb. Other changes in the proprietary followed in succession, one of
which was that a minister, the Rev. W. Parsons, married Miss Ackroyd,
and thus became a partner; and for a time the style of the firm was
changed from “Hartley, Greens, &amp; Co.,” to “Greens, Hartley, &amp; Co.”
These repeated changes, and the unpleasantness and disputes that
arose in consequence appear to have been detrimental to the concern,
which was ultimately thrown into Chancery, and a large portion of the
stock sold off. Some idea of the extent of the business done about
this time may be formed from the fact, which I have gathered from a
personal reference to the accounts, that the annual sales amounted, in
round numbers, to about £30,000; that about £8,000 was paid in wages,
and more than £2,000 for coals, even with the decided advantage of
reduction in price by the arrangement spoken of.</p>

<p>In 1825, by an advantageous arrangement effected through the good
offices of his friend Mr. Hardy, the then Recorder of Leeds, I am
informed, the affair was got out of Chancery, and passed, by purchase,
into the hands of Mr. Samuel Wainwright, one of the partners. The
concern was at this time, I believe, carried on in the name of “Samuel
Wainwright and Company,” and was conducted with great spirit. Mr.
Wainwright engaged as his confidential cashier Stephen Chappell, who
up to that time was employed as a bookkeeper in one of the Leeds
cloth manufactories.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> At Wainwright’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[473]</span> death (of cholera) in
1832, the trustees carried on the business under the style of the
“Leeds Pottery Company,” and employed Stephen Chappell as their sole
manager. This arrangement continued until the year 1840, when the
trustees transferred the whole concern to Chappell, who took it at
his own valuation. Shortly after this time his brother James became a
partner in the concern, the firm then consisting simply of “Stephen and
James Chappell,” who continued the works until 1847, when they became
bankrupt. The pottery was then carried on for about three years, for
the benefit of the creditors, by the assignees, under the management of
Mr. Richard Britton, who had for some time held a confidential position
with Mr. Chappell. In 1850 the concern passed, by purchase, into the
hands of Mr. Samuel Warburton and this same Mr. Richard Britton, and
was by them carried on under the style of “Warburton and Britton,”
until 1863, when, on the death of Mr. Warburton, Mr. Richard Britton
became sole proprietor of the works. On July 1st, 1872, he was joined
in partnership by his two eldest sons, John Broadbent Britton and
Alfred Britton, the firm at the present time being “Richard Britton &amp;
Sons.”</p>

<p>The Leeds Pot Works are situated in Jack Lane, and occupy an area of
considerably more than seven acres of ground, and at the present time
give employment to about two hundred and fifty persons. The premises
are intersected for a considerable portion of their length by the
Brandling’s Railway, and are also crossed in a cutting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[474]</span> by the main
line of the Midland Railway. The works are very extensive, and, with
but some trifling alterations, now stand as they did in the time of
Hartley, Greens, &amp; Co. Closely adjoining them is the Leathley Lane
Pottery.</p>

<p>The wares manufactured at different periods at these interesting
works consist of the coarse brown earthenwares, made on its first
establishment; delft-ware, produced only in small quantities, and for a
short period; hard and highly vitrified stone ware, with a strong salt
glaze; cream-coloured, or Queen’s ware; Egyptian black ware; Rockingham
ware; white earthenware; yellow ware, &amp;c., &amp;c. The great speciality of
the works was the perforated “Queen’s or cream-coloured earthenware,”
for which they became universally famed, and successfully competed with
Wedgwood. It is this kind of ware which among collectors has acquired
the name of “Leeds Ware.” To this it will be necessary to direct
careful attention, and to point out both the peculiarities of pattern
and of ornamentation which they exhibit.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image474">

    class="p1"   
    src="images/image474.jpg"
     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center sm">Figs. 848 and 849.</p>
  </div>

<p>In colour the old Leeds ware—<i>i.e.</i>, the cream-coloured
earthenware—is of a particularly clear rich tint, usually rather
deeper in tone than Wedgwood’s Queen’s ware, and of a slightly
yellowish cast. The body is particularly fine and hard, and the glaze
of extremely good quality. This glaze was produced with arsenic, and
its use was so deleterious to the workmen, that they usually became
hopelessly crippled after four or five years’ exposure to its effects.
It is not now used.</p>

<p>The perforated pieces, as well as those of open basket-work,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[475]</span> exhibit
an unusual degree of skill and an elaborateness of design that is quite
unequalled. The example (Fig. <a href="#image474">848</a>), is a chestnut basket and stand, of
the finest and most elaborate description. In form it is faultless,
as it is also in moulding, and there is considerable elegance in the
general outline. The upper part of the cover, and the lower portion
of the bowl are fluted, and the handles, which are double twisted,
terminate in flowers and foliage. Both bowl and cover are elaborately
perforated; and here it may be well to note, for the information of
collectors, that the perforations of this description were produced
by punches, by which the soft clay was pierced by hand. I name this
more particularly because I have heard an opinion expressed, by those
not conversant with the matter, that this description of open-work
was produced in the mould. The fact of each of the perforations being
produced separately by the hands of the workman, adds materially to
the interest attached to the piece, and to its value. It may also be
remarked that the wholesale price of this piece (eleven inches in
diameter), the pattern for which was probably produced about 1782–83,
was, in 1794, 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>—a price which collectors at the
present time would gladly triple and even quadruple.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image475">

  </div>

<p>Fig. <a href="#image474">849</a> is an oval butter-tub and stand, of peculiarly elegant design,
belonging to Mr. Manning. It is well covered with embossed work, and
has both cover and stand very nicely perforated, the perforations being
produced in the same manner as the one just described, by punches. The
handles are ribbed and double twisted, with foliated terminations. The
next illustration shows one of the “pierced fruit baskets” for which
these works were very famous, and I have chosen it because it shows the
combination of the pierced work with painting. These, and the asparagus
shell (Fig. <a href="#image475">850</a>), engraved to show how the peculiar art of these works
was applied to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[476]</span> the simplest things, will be sufficient to illustrate
this variety of pottery.</p>

<p>The next variety is that of twig baskets, of which Fig. <a href="#image475">852</a> is a good
and characteristic example. In these pieces, which were produced
in different varieties of wicker-work, the “twigs,” or “withies,”
are really composed of clay in long or short “strips,” as occasion
required, and then twisted and formed into shape. The process was one
which required considerable care and nicety in manipulation, and was
well calculated to exhibit the skill of the workman. Baskets of this
kind were made by various makers, as well as at Leeds, and all on much
the same model, so that without an intimate knowledge of the body and
glaze of the Leeds ware, it is difficult to distinguish them from
others. One of these baskets on its oval stand or dish (the wholesale
price in 1794 ranging from 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i>, according to size) is engraved in the book of patterns of
which I have spoken, and those who are fortunate enough to possess, or
to be able to refer to that extremely scarce work, “Wedgwood’s Engraved
Pattern Book” (18 plates, 4to.), will there find one engraved on Plate
13, Fig. <a href="#image475">851</a>. The same baskets were produced at Castleford and Don, and
by Staffordshire houses.</p>

  </div>

<p>Another characteristic variety of Leeds work was the combination in
basket-work, &amp;c., of embossed patterns with perforations. Of these I
give an excellent example on the accompanying engraving, in which the
rim of the dish is embossed and pierced in basket-work. The way in
which this was produced was this. The plate, dish, basket, or other
piece, was formed in the mould so that the pattern stood out in relief
above the parts intended to be incised. These were then cut out by
hand, with a penknife, leaving the pattern entirely in open-work. The
dish here engraved is one of the simplest kind, but is an extremely
early specimen, having probably been made about 1779, and is therefore
a good illustration of this class of work. It is marked in small
capital letters <span class="allsmcap">LEEDS POTTERY</span>.</p>

<p>In this same ware—the Queen’s or cream-coloured earthenware—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[477]</span>
Leeds works produced services of various kinds, as well as the usual
vessels for domestic use, and works of Art in the shape of vases,
candelabra, centres, &amp;c. &amp;c. Of the services, which, as a rule, were
of remarkably elegant forms, and produced with extreme skill in
workmanship, it will not be necessary to give illustrations. Of the
more decorative pieces, however, I give Figs. <a href="#image477b">854 to 856</a>, engravings,
because it is well to show collectors to what degree of perfection in
design these almost forgotten works had arrived. The first example
which I engrave is a magnificent centre, or “grand platt menage,” of
four tiers. It is composed of five separate pieces. The base is rock,
and each tier is composed of shells after the fashion of the Plymouth
designs. The shells are supported on elegant brackets, and the whole
piece is surmounted by a well-modelled female figure.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#image477b">855</a> shows a <i>jardinière</i> of very elegant and effective
design, of cornucopia form, with a head of Flora, crowned with flowers,
in front, and festoons above held by a ram’s and an eagle’s head; and
Fig. <a href="#image478">856</a> exhibits a “grand platt menage,” similar to that engraved on
Plate 26 (Fig. 106) of the “Book of Patterns.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[478]</span></p>

<p>In the plate to which I have referred this elegant piece has a base for
cruets added, and is somewhat different in some of its details, but
it is much the same in general design. Around the centre of the base,
it will be noticed, is a series of rams’ heads with large bent horns,
hooked at the end, and the foliage beneath the pine-apple at the top
is also deeply bent downwards, and the point of each leaf hooked up
at the end. On these—the horns and leaves—it was intended to hang
small earthenware wicker-work baskets, and on the engraving to which
I have alluded, these are all shown <i>in situ</i>. It is interesting
to note that in Mr. Hailstone’s collection is a precisely similar
piece, but with the addition of a circular base, which is of Wedgwood’s
Queen’s ware, and is marked <span class="allsmcap">WEDGWOOD</span> in the usual manner. This
circumstance shows that the design was common to both manufactories,
and the natural inference to be drawn is that Messrs. Hartley, Greens,
&amp; Co., in this instance, as in others, copied and reproduced Wedgwood’s
designs; while in other instances it is equally possible Wedgwood
copied from them. It is curious in going through the pattern-books of
Hartley, Greens, &amp; Co. of 1783, and downwards to 1814, Wedgwood’s of
1815, and the “Don,” to note the similarity of designs exhibited, some
of which are so nearly identical, as to appear almost to have been
produced from the same moulds.</p>

<p>A teapot, dated 1777, has been ascribed to the Leeds works; but I am

<p>The vases, scent jars, cockle pots, and <i>potpourri</i> produced at
Leeds, were many of them of very elaborate and elegant designs, and
of large size, and were decorated with raised figures, medallions,
flowers, festoons, shells, &amp;c., and with perforated work. They were
also frequently painted, or enamelled, in various colours, blue,
green, and red being the prevailing ones. One “cockle pot,” 22 inches
in height, has a square stand, highly decorated with shells, &amp;c., in
relief, and with perforations, standing on four feet. At each corner
is a raised seated figure. From the centre rises the stem, supporting
a solid globe, on which rests the bowl, supported by mermaids. The
bowl is decorated with festoons of shells, flowers, and sea-weeds in
high relief. The cover is also ornamented with raised groups of shells
and seaweed, and is perforated in an elaborate and somewhat intricate
pattern. It is surmounted by a spirited figure of Neptune with his
trident and horses.</p>

<p>Candlesticks were made in great variety, and were highly decorated.
Some were in the form of vases, and in this variety vases were produced
in the same manner as Wedgwood’s jasper ware, with reversible tops,
so as to serve either as ornaments only, or as candlesticks. Others
have dolphins; others again Corinthian and other pillars; others have
massive bases perforated and embossed, while the candlestick itself
rose from griffins; and others again are vases with branches for two
or more candles springing out from their tops. These are now of great
rarity, as, indeed, are many of the productions of the Leeds works.</p>

<p>Single figures, and groups of figures, were also produced, principally
in the plain cream-coloured ware, but sometimes painted. It is also
said that some minute works of Art, small cameos, were made at Leeds.
A pair of these, said to be authenticated as Leeds manufacture, are in
the possession of Mr. Ferns, who is also the owner of many excellent
specimens of perforated ware.</p>

<p>In Mr. Hailstone’s possession is a remarkably fine fountain of large
size. It has a dolphin spout, shell terminations, mermaids and shells
for handles, and has figures and ornaments in relief in front.</p>

<p>In tea, coffee, and chocolate services, a large variety of patterns
were produced; both plain, engined, fluted, pierced, and otherwise
decorated. Many of these are of similar form to Wedgwood’s, to whom
their manipulation would, indeed, have been no discredit. The great
peculiarity of the tea and coffee pots, &amp;c., is their double twisted
handles, with flowers and leaves for terminations. Many of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[480]</span> these are
extremely beautiful, both in design and in execution. These services
were made either in plain cream-colour, or painted with borders and
sprigs of flowers in various colours. The chocolate cups are usually
two-handled, or without handles. The stands are, in many instances,
highly ornamented with perforations, or take the form of melon or other
leaves, and have ornamental sockets for the cups attached. Several
patterns appear in the engravings of which I have spoken. Tea-kettles
and milk-pails with covers were also made, and in the possession of the
late Mr. Lucas was a fine example of a tea-kettle with double twisted
handle, with foliated terminations.</p>

<p>In the early part of the present century, white earthenware was made
at these works. It was a fine, hard, compact body, and had, like
the cream-coloured, a remarkably good glaze. In this ware services,
especially dinner and tea, were produced, and were decorated with
transfer printing, painting, lustre, and tinsel. “Tinselling,” it must
be understood, is the peculiar process by which a part of the pattern
is made to assume a metallic appearance by being washed here and there
over the transfer or drawing. Examples of these, consisting of plates,
and a cup and saucer, belonging to Mr. Manning and Mr. Davis, are
marked with the curved mark to be hereafter described.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image480">

    src="images/image480.jpg"
     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center sm">Fig. 857.</p>
  </div>

<p>The plates also bear a small blue-pencilled letter C, and impressed
flower of seven lobes, and kind of cross pattée; these are, of course,
workmen’s marks. The cup and saucer in Mr. Davis’s possession have
flowers and rude landscape in colours and copper-coloured “tinsel.”</p>

<p>An excellent example of the white earthenware of Leeds is the puzzle
jug in the possession of Mr. Alfred Britton, here engraved (Fig. <a href="#image480">857</a>).
This is one of the most elaborate in design, and careful in execution,
which has come under my notice. The upper part is ornamented with
“punched” perforations, and the centre of the jug is open throughout,
having an open flower on either side, between which is a swan standing
clear in the inside. The jug is painted with borders and sprigs of
flowers, and is marked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[481]</span> with the usual impressed mark of <span class="allsmcap">LEEDS
POTTERY</span>. A curious example of the white earthenware is in the
possession of Mr. Hailstone. It is a large jug, having on one side a
spirited engraving of “the Vicar and Moses” in black transfer printing,
and coloured, and on the other side the old ballad of “the Vicar and
Moses,” engraved in two columns, and surrounded by a border. In front
of the jug, pendent from the spout, is painted the arms of the borough
of Leeds, the golden fleece, commonly called the “tup in trouble.” On
each side of this are the initials J. B. and S. B., and beneath are the
words—“Success to Leeds Manufactory.”</p>

<p>Transfer printing was introduced at Leeds, probably, about 1780, but
this is very uncertain. In the title-page of the “Book of Patterns in
1783,” it is said, “the same enamel’d, <i>Printed</i> or Ornamented
with Gold to any pattern; also with Coats of Arms, Cyphers, Landscapes,
&amp;c.;” and in 1791, the copper-plates then in use were valued at £204.
The patterns were principally willow pattern, Nankin pattern, borders,
groups of flowers, landscapes, and ruins. I may mention that several of
the original pattern-books of drawings of the articles themselves, and
of borders and other decorations, of the early Leeds productions are in
my own possession.</p>

<p>Lustre, both gold and silver, was used occasionally in the decorations
at Leeds, and excellent examples of “lustre ware” were also produced.
These, like the other early productions of the works, are scarce.</p>

<p>About the year 1800, black ware was introduced at Leeds. This was of
the same character as the Egyptian black, then so largely made in
Staffordshire by Wedgwood, by Mayer, by Neale, and others. The body
is extremely compact, firm, and hard, but had a more decided bluish
cast than is usual in other makes. In this ware, tea and coffee pots,
the latter both with spouts and with snips, cream ewers, and other
articles were made. I believe there are but few collectors cognizant
of the fact that this Egyptian black ware was made at Leeds at all;
but I have been fortunate enough, by careful examination, to ascertain
that up to 1812–13, probably from ninety to a hundred distinct patterns
and sizes of teapots alone were produced in black at these works. This
is an interesting fact to note, and is one which will call attention
for the first time to this particular branch of Leeds manufacture.
The patterns of the teapots were very varied, both in form, in style
of ornamentation, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[482]</span> size. In form were round, oval, octagonal,
and other shapes, including some of twelve sides. In ornamentation
some were engine-turned in a variety of patterns, while others were
chequered or fluted. Others again were formed in moulds elaborately
ornamented in relief with flowers, fruits, borders, festoons, &amp;c., &amp;c.;
while others still had groups of figures, trophies, and medallions in
relief on their sides. The “knobs” of the lids were seated figures,
lions, swans, flowers, &amp;c., &amp;c. The lids were made of every variety,
both inward and outward fitting, sliding, and attached with hinges. In
speaking of engine-turning, it may be well to note that “engined” mugs,
jugs, &amp;c., were made at these works as early as 1782, if not at an
earlier date. And here, in connection with the black ware, let me note
too, that pot-works were established at Swinton, by some of the family
of the Greens, of Leeds (see Swinton); and that here, too, black ware
teapots were made, which were known as “Swinton pattern.” Of these I
shall have more to say in my account of the Swinton works.</p>

<p>The marks used at Leeds are not numerous, and are easily distinguished.
Collectors, however, need to be told that very few indeed of the
productions of this manufactory were marked. The great bulk of the
pottery, whether in Queen’s ware or otherwise, was made for foreign
markets—Russia, Holland, Spain, Germany, Portugal, France, &amp;c.—and
as a rule the goods were sent off unmarked. It is worthy of note, too,
that the finest examples of Leeds make, both in the perforated and
other varieties, now known, have been recovered from the Continent.
To illustrate this remark, it will be only necessary to point to the
chestnut basket just described and engraved, which was purchased and
brought from Holland a few years ago. The marks, so far as I have been
able to ascertain, which were used at the Leeds works, and of each of
which examples are in my own collection, are the following—</p>

<p class="center">LEEDS · POTTERY*</p>

<p class="p-left">in large capitals, with a terminal asterisk impressed. This
mark occurs on a large-sized “Melon Terine” same as the one engraved in
the pattern-book of 1783, figure 68, plate 16. On the same piece are a
large capital letter S impressed, and the number 12 incised. These are
of course workmen’s or pattern marks.</p>

<p>Many good examples of Leeds wares are preserved in the Museum of
Practical Geology. Among these one is marked with the impressed Leeds
mark twice in form of a saltire (Fig. <a href="#image483c">860</a>).</p>

<p>The marks usually ascribed to Leeds are the following:—but there
is no proof that any of these were ever used at the works. In my
own possession is a dessert service with
<img src="images/image483d.jpg" alt=""
style="height:1em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">
the “sponged” border (which was used at
Leeds), and a series of extremely fine and thoroughly artistic figures,
cupids, &amp;c., engraved in stipple, and printed in a warm pinkish brown
colour, which bears the first of these three marks; but although it is
ascribed to Leeds, I have grave doubts as to the correctness of the
appropriation.</p>

<p>Mr. Chaffers, in his first edition, says: “The mark of C. G. has been
attributed to Charles Green, of Leeds; that in the margin is on a
cup and saucer of white English china, with paintings of landscapes
and the raised wicker border, common to this manufactory.”
<img src="images/image483e.jpg" alt=""
style="height:1.5em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">
I quote this for the purpose of showing
how little reliance can be placed on the information hitherto given
with respect to these works. So far as my researches go, I do not find
there was a <i>Charles</i> Green connected with the Leeds works; and
that <i>china</i> was never made there I am fully convinced. This mark of
<img src="images/image483e.jpg" alt=""
style="height:1.2em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">
does occur upon a
china cup and saucer which has come under my notice: but it has not any
connection with the Leeds works.</p>

<p>The Leeds Pottery at the present time produces the ordinary
descriptions of earthenware for domestic use, consisting of dinner ware
in great variety, tea and coffee, toilet, and other services, jugs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[484]</span>
and mugs, screw jugs, bowls and basins, and, indeed, all articles in
general use. In dinner ware upwards of ten standard patterns are made
for the London market, which market takes nearly one-half of the whole
productions of the works in general goods. The white earthenware is of
the same quality as the ordinary run of Staffordshire ware, and has
a good glaze. It is produced in the usual styles of blue printing,
painting and edging. Pearl white of good quality, both plain and
decorated, is also manufactured. This pearl body is got up in toilet
ware, varying in patterns, printed lines, and fancy stamped; jugs
embossed and plain; tea and breakfast services, &amp;c. It is also being
introduced for washing-machines, substituting earthenware bottoms for
wood; also for patented machines for cloth manufacturers. These were
first shown at the Leeds Exhibition of 1875. Scent-jars, leech-jars,
&amp;c., &amp;c., are also largely made.</p>

<p>In Rockingham ware, tea and coffee pots and other articles are
still made in considerable quantities; as are also Egyptian black
glazed wares and yellow earthenware, which is made from native clays
procured from Wortley. Thus it will be seen that the Leeds potteries
of the present day—of the very existence of which but few persons
are aware—are of considerable size and importance, and are doing a
large business—a business which, unlike that of the olden times, is
principally confined to the supplying of the home markets, where, not
being marked, the ware usually passes for that of Staffordshire.</p>

<p>The marks used at the present day are, an old English letter L
<img src="images/image484.jpg" alt=""
style="height:1em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;">

 within a gothic quatrefoil in a circle, impressed in the body
of the ware; or the name of the pattern within an ornamental circle,
and, below it, the initials of the firm, R. B. &amp; S., printed on the
surface.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Leathley Lane Pottery.</h3>

<p>Closely adjoining the works I have been noticing is another small
pottery, of whose history a few words may be said. They were
established in the early part of the present century, by, I believe, a
Mr. North, for the manufacture of black ware, but were afterwards used
by the same person for the making of the ordinary white earthenware.
From Mr. North the works passed into the hands of a Mr. Hepworth,
who made the ordinary brown salt-glazed ware. It was next worked by
Mr. Dawson, one of the trustees of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[485]</span> the Leeds pottery, who took into
partnership Mr. Chappell, of whom I have spoken as, for a period,
proprietor of the Leeds pottery; and it was for some time carried on
by Dawson and Chappell, afterwards by Chappell alone, and then by
Shackleton, Taylor and Co. This partnership was dissolved in 1851,
and the works were then continued by two of the former proprietors,
Messrs. Taylor and Gibson. Since 1859, the factory has been continued
to the present time by Messrs. Gibson &amp; Co. The premises are small,
and produce only the commoner and inferior kinds of earthenware for
domestic purposes. These are white ware of the commonest kind, yellow
ware made from the Wortley clays, and Rockingham ware.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Castleford.</h3>

<p>Castleford, which has its stations on the “North-Eastern” and on the
“Lancashire and Yorkshire,” and is in direct communication with the
Midland and Great Northern Railways, lies about twelve miles from
Leeds. It is, in great measure, supported by its glasshouses, its
chemical works, and its potteries, which are still in full operation.
Common brown ware had, I believe, been made for a considerable
period, on the spot, the goods produced, of course, being pancheons
and the ordinary classes of coarse vessels. The Castleford Pottery
was established, towards the close of the last century, by David
Dunderdale, for the manufacture of the finer kinds of earthenware, more
especially Queen’s or cream-coloured ware, which was then being made
so largely at Leeds and other places, as well as in Staffordshire. Mr.
Dunderdale took into partnership a Mr. Plowes, and in 1803, the firm
of D. Dunderdale &amp; Co., which appears stamped on the goods, consisted
of these two persons. The partnership was not of long duration, and
after considerable dissension, was dissolved, Mr. Plowes removing
to Ferrybridge, where he joined the proprietors of the pot-works
there, his son removing to London, and Mr. Dunderdale continuing the
Castleford Works alone. The next partner was Mr. Thomas Edward Upton,
a relative of Mr. Dunderdale’s, and these two shortly afterwards took
into partnership John Bramley (or Bramler) and Thomas Russell, who was
not a practical potter, but was an hotel proprietor at Harrogate. At
this time the proprietary was thus divided:—Dunderdale one half of
the concern, Russell a fourth, and Upton and Bramley an eighth each.
Considerable additions were made to the works at this time, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[486]</span>
change in the proprietary was commemorated by a grand feast, and by
bonfires, and all kinds of extravagant rejoicings.</p>

<p>In 1820 the manufactory was closed, and in 1821 a part of the works
was taken by some of the workmen—George Asquith, William and
Daniel Byford, Richard Gill, James Sharp, and David Hingham. They
were succeeded by Taylor, Harrison, &amp; Co., Harrison having been an
apprentice of David Dunderdale’s; and the place was for several years
carried on by the latter and the son of the former, under the style of
Taylor and Harrison. It is now closed as an earthenware manufactory
(Messrs. Taylor and Harrison having given up the trade), and is carried
on for stoneware alone. At these works, an offshoot, as I have shown,
of the old pottery, the commoner descriptions of goods only are made.</p>

<p>At the close of the year 1825, I believe, the old works were taken
by Asquith, Wood, &amp; Co. They were joined in partnership by Thomas
Nicholson, who had served his apprenticeship with Hartley, Greens, &amp;
Co., of the Leeds Pottery, and carried on the business as Asquith,
Wood, and Nicholson, and afterwards as Wood and Nicholson alone. In
1854 another change took place, by which Mr. Nicholson, one of the old
firm, retained the works, and took into partnership Thomas Hartley,
the style of the firm being Thomas Nicholson &amp; Co. A few years ago
Mr. Nicholson retired from the concern, and it was then carried on
by Thomas Hartley alone, and afterwards with partners, under the old
name of Nicholson &amp; Co. In December, 1871, Mr. Hartley died, and
the Castleford Pottery was then, and still is, carried on by his
co-partners, Hugh McDowall Clokie, and John Masterman, under the style
of “Clokie and Masterman.”</p>

<p>The Castleford Works, under David Dunderdale &amp; Co., did a large trade
with Spain, the Baltic, and other “foreign parts,” principally in
cream-coloured ware, and it is said that during the war the losses
were so great, both in earthenware and in specie, as to cripple the
works, and lead to their being closed. So great was the export trade
of the firm, that they owned vessels of heavy burthen, which were kept
trading with the Spanish and other ports. It is related that just
before the peace of Amiens, one of Dunderdale’s ships was closely and
hotly chased, but succeeded in outstripping her would-be captors. This
was celebrated at Castleford, and the circumstance was remembered as
“Dunkirk Races,” and is still talked of with pride by one or two of the
old people with whom I have conversed.</p>

<p>As I have said, the staple production of the Castleford Pottery in
Dunderdale’s time was the “Queen’s” or “cream-coloured ware,” which was
made of an excellent quality, and of a good colour. In appearance it
assimilated pretty closely to the cream ware made at the Herculaneum
Works, and was not so fine or so perfect in glaze as that made at
Leeds. In this ware dinner, dessert, and other services, as well
as open-work baskets, vases, candlesticks, and a large variety of
other articles, were made, both plain and painted, or enamelled, and
decorated with transfer printing. In the accompanying engraving are
shown some examples. Fig. <a href="#image487a">862</a> is one of a set of four central covered
dishes painted in sepia with a border of vine leaves, grapes, and
tendrils, of precisely the same design as appears on examples of
Wedgwood’s make, and of Herculaneum, and other places. This set of
dishes, when placed together for use, forms a circle of twenty-two
inches in diameter. The sauce-boat (Fig. <a href="#image487a">863</a>) is a part of the same
service. The small oval sauce tureen (Fig. <a href="#image487a">861</a>) and ladle show that
double-twisted handles were made at Castleford as well as at Leeds, at
Swinton, and other places. Open-work baskets, stands, plates, dishes,
&amp;c., were produced in great variety, and of designs in many instances
closely resembling those of Leeds and other places. The accompanying
engraving (Fig. <a href="#image487b">864</a>)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[488]</span> exhibits one of these. In what would now be
called Parian, the Castleford Works in their early days produced some
remarkably good and effective pieces. One of these, a hot-milk jug with
its cover, shown on Fig. <a href="#image487b">865</a> is beautifully decorated with foliated and
other borders, and with groups of figures in relief. Mugs, and other
articles of the same material, were also produced. Examples of this
kind of ware may be seen in the Museum of Practical Geology, Jermyn
Street, and in many private collections.</p>

<p>Black or Egyptian ware of fine quality was made at Castleford in its
palmy days, and is now of some degree of rarity. In my friend C. Roach
Smith’s possession is a part of a service of this material, in which
the hot-milk jug is of precisely the same pattern as the one engraved
above. In fine white earthenware a large variety of goods was made by
Dunderdale &amp; Co., who produced a remarkably hard and compact body, and
a glaze of considerable merit. In the late Mr. Pulleine’s possession,
among other examples, was an oval fruit-dish, painted inside with a
broad, bold, but not elegant border in red, and in the centre, in an
oval, a landscape, with water, buildings, trees, figures, &amp;c., in the
same colour on a red tinted ground.</p>

<p>The marks used at these works appear to have been very few, and are
easily recognised. They are—</p>

<p class="p-left">impressed in the ware. The mark of the later proprietors
when trading as “T. Nicholson &amp; Co.,” was a circular garter, surmounted
by a crown, and on the ribbon the initials of the firm—“T. N. &amp; Co.”;
in the centre the name of the pattern. The mark of the present firm is
their initials within a border.</p>

<p>At the present day the Castleford Pottery, as carried on by Clokie
and Masterman, manufactures all the ordinary kinds of earthenware,
including white, printed, sponged, and the very commonest kinds of
painted varieties; the principal patterns of services being “Willow,”
“Wild Rose,” “Albion,” “Gem,” “Eton College,” “Verona,” etc., which are
produced in blue, green, brown, and other colours. The body is firm and
good, and the glaze of the usual quality. The old glory of the works
has, however, long departed, and nothing artistic or beautiful is now
to be seen in the place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[489]</span> where once so many choice articles might be
found. There is in connection with the pottery a flint mill, where
flint, stone, glaze and colour are ground, and the clay is prepared by
hydraulic pressure.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The <i>Eagle Pottery</i> was established in 1854 by a company of
workmen, under the style of “John Roberts &amp; Co.,” and afterwards taken
by Messrs. Pratt &amp; Co., who sold the concern to Mr. H. McDowall,
who continued to trade under the original style. Since the death of
Mr. McDowall the buildings have been converted into a glass bottle
manufactory. Only the most common classes of earthenware were produced.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Pontefract.</h3>

<p>Thoresby records that Francis Place, of the Manor House at York, spent
much money upon his manufacture of “fine muggs,” and that he attempted
it solely from a turn for experiments; but one Clifton, of Pontefract,
took the hint from him, and made a fortune by it. The works of Mr.
Clifton would probably be the forerunners of those of Ferrybridge, near
the “town of liquorice.”</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ferrybridge Pottery</span> is situated at Ferrybridge, by
Knottingley, and only a short distance from that famous seat of the
growth of liquorice, Pontefract, whose “Pomfret cakes” are so well and,
indeed, universally known. The pot-works at Ferrybridge are among the
largest, if they are not the very largest, in Yorkshire, and have the
reputation of being well arranged and convenient. They were established
in 1792, by Mr. William Tomlinson, who had for partners Mr. Seaton,
an eminent banker of Pontefract; Mr. Foster, a wealthy shipowner, of
Selby; Mr. Timothy Smith, a coal proprietor; and Mr. Thompson, an
independent gentleman, residing at Selby. The firm was styled “William
Tomlinson &amp; Co.,” until about the year 1796, when the proprietors took
into partnership Ralph Wedgwood, of Burslem, when the style was changed
to that of “Tomlinson, Foster, Wedgwood, &amp; Co.”</p>

<p>Ralph Wedgwood was the eldest son of Thomas Wedgwood, of Etruria
(the cousin and partner of Josiah Wedgwood), and was brought up at
that place under his uncle and father. He was brother to John Taylor
Wedgwood, the eminent line engraver, whose works are so justly in
repute.</p>

<p>In my “Life of Josiah Wedgwood,” I gave, for the first time, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[490]</span> the
result of considerable research, a notice of this remarkable man, Ralph
Wedgwood, and of his inventions, and his family<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and connections.</p>

<p>Ralph Wedgwood, who was a man of extraordinary and varied ability, the
originator of many important scientific inventions, and the author of
the “Book of Remembrance,” published in 1814, in which the invention
of the electric telegraph, under the name of the “fulguripolygraph,”
is made known, and its benefits—precisely such as are now reaped
by the public—are described, was born in 1766, and was brought up
with his father at Etruria, where he received much valuable aid in
chemistry, &amp;c., from Josiah Wedgwood. He afterwards carried on business
as a potter, under the style of “Wedgwood &amp; Co.,” at the Hill Works,
Burslem; but was ruined through losses during the war. While at the
Hill, he prepared and presented to Queen Charlotte some fine examples
of his manufacture, on the occasion of the restoration of health to
the king, which were graciously accepted through the hands of Lord
Cremorne. He then removed into Yorkshire, where, as I have stated, he
entered into partnership with Messrs. Tomlinson &amp; Co., of Ferrybridge,
and thus again commenced business. This engagement, however, was not
of long duration, his partners being dissatisfied at the large amount
of breakage caused by his experiments and peculiar mode of firing,
and the partnership being dissolved he retired from the concern,
having succeeded in getting a thousand pounds awarded to him as his
share of the business. He next removed to Bransford, near Worcester,
where he issued prospectuses for teaching chemistry at schools,
and thence to London, in 1803, travelling in a carriage of his own
constructing, which he describes as “a long coach to get out behind,
and on grasshopper springs, now used by all the mails.” This carriage
was so extraordinary in its appearance as to be taken for a travelling
show. While at Bransford he had been perfecting his inventions, among
which was his celebrated manifold writer, which still maintains its
high repute “against all comers.” One of his copying schemes, which
he called a “Penna-polygraph,” that of writing with a number of pens
attached to one handle, he found, on his arrival in London, had
already been made by another person. His other plan, proving to be
new, he called the “Pocket Secretary,” and afterwards the “Manifold
Writer;” and on the 7th of October, 1806, after much discouragement
and opposition, he took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">[491]</span> out a patent for this as “an apparatus for
producing duplicates of writing.” In 1808 he took out a second patent
for “an apparatus for producing several original writings or drawings
one and at the same time, which I shall call a Pennæpolygraph, or pen
and stylographic manifold writer.” An “ærial zone” was also proposed by
him, and his invention was laid before the Admiralty, but judging from
the following extract from a letter now lying before me, the invention
was not considered to be a very feasible one. “The ærial zone is in
proper hands if it is laid before the Admiralty, for there does not
seem to be any greater likelihood of its becoming an article of general
use than there is of the ladies leaving off muslin because some lose
their lives every year by its use.”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>In 1806, Ralph Wedgwood established himself at Charing Cross, and soon
afterwards his whole attention began to be engrossed with his scheme of
the electric telegraph, first invented by his father, Thomas Wedgwood,
which, in the then unsettled state of the kingdom—in midst of war, it
must be remembered—he considered would be of the utmost importance to
the government. In 1814, having perfected his scheme, he submitted his
proposal to Lord Castlereagh, and most anxiously awaited the result.
His son Ralph having waited on his lordship for a decision as to
whether government would accept the plan or not, was informed that “the
war being at an end, the old system was sufficient for the country!”
The plan, therefore, fell to the ground, until Professor Wheatstone, in
happier and more enlightened times, again brought the subject forward
with such eminent success. The plan, thus brought forward by Ralph
Wedgwood in 1814 (and, as I have stated, he received the first idea
from his father), was thus described by him in a pamphlet entitled, “An
Address to the Public, on the advantages of a proposed introduction of
the Stylographic Principle of writing into general use; and also of an
improved species of Telegraphy, calculated for the use of the Public as
well as for the Government.” The pamphlet is dated May 29, 1815.</p>

<p>Ralph Wedgwood from Charing Cross removed successively to Piccadilly,
and Southampton Street, Strand, where he continued producing his
“Pocket Secretary” in large numbers, and did a profitable business. The
advantages he gained were, however, lost by his researches concerning
the electric telegraph, and in the end his business gradually decayed.
He was a man of too eccentric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[492]</span> and visionary nature for the ordinary
pursuits of life, and was thus led into the speculative ideas rather
than the substantialities of worldly existence. Among his schemes was
one for the founding of an universal language, over which he held a
lengthy and elaborate correspondence with Percy Bysshe Shelley and
other men of the day. He died at Chelsea in 1837. He was three times
married—first to Mary Yeomans, of Worcester, by whom he had issue
Ralph Wedgwood, of Barnes and Cornhill; secondly, to Sarah Taylor; and
thirdly, to Anne Copeland, by each of whom also he had issue.</p>

<p>After the dissolution of the partnership at Ferrybridge, which took
place, I believe, about 1800 or 1801, when Wedgwood ceased to have
any connection with the concern, the firm of “Tomlinson &amp; Co.” was
resumed, and so continued until 1834, when it changed to “Tomlinson,
Plowes, &amp; Co.;” Mr. Plowes, of the Castleford Works, having joined the
proprietary.</p>

<p>In 1804, the name of the manufactory, which, up to that period, had
been called the <i>Knottingley Pottery</i>, was changed to that of the
<i>Ferrybridge Pottery</i>. This change was made for the convenience
of foreign correspondence—a large foreign trade being carried
on—Ferrybridge being at that time a post-town of some note, and the
works being situated nearer to it than to Knottingley.</p>

<p>Mr. Tomlinson was succeeded by his son Mr. Edward Tomlinson, who
continued the works under the firm of Edward Tomlinson &amp; Co., until
the year 1826, when he finally retired from the concern. A part of the
premises were then worked for a short time by Messrs. Wigglesworth
and Ingham; when the whole place was taken by Messrs. Reed, Taylor,
and Kelsall, who continued the manufactory until the retirement of
Mr. Kelsall, after which the works were continued by the surviving
partners, Messrs. James Reed and Benjamin Taylor. Mr. Reed, who was
father of Mr. John Reed, of the “Mexborough Pottery,” was a man of
enlarged experience, of matured judgment, and of great practical skill;
and in his time many improvements in the ware were made, and the
manufacture of china introduced. He, in conjunction with his partner,
took the Mexborough Pottery, and for some time carried on the two
establishments conjointly. Ultimately Mr. Reed gave up the Ferrybridge
works, and confined himself to those at Mexborough, while Mr. Taylor
carried on the Ferrybridge works alone.</p>

<p>After Mr. Taylor gave up the works Mr. Lewis Woolf entered upon them
as tenant for a few years, and in 1856 became the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[493]</span> purchaser, and
commenced manufacturing in his own name, and has continued from that
time until the present day. In the following year, 1857, a large
additional pottery was built closely adjoining, and, indeed, connected
with the “Ferrybridge Pottery,” by the sons of Mr. Lewis Woolf. This
new manufactory was called the “Australian Pottery,” and is still in
full work. The proprietors of the joint works, “The Ferrybridge and
Australian Potteries,” as they are named, now are Lewis, Sidney, and
Henry Woolf, who trade under the style of “Lewis Woolf and Sons.”</p>

<p>These works, besides a very large local and coasting trade, had
extensive transactions with several foreign ports. From their first
establishment to the time of the issuing of the famous Berlin decree
by Napoleon, Messrs. Tomlinson &amp; Co. had done a very extensive and
lucrative trade with Russia, for which country the finer and more
expensive kinds of earthenware, including cream-colour, Egyptian black,
and other kinds of fancy bodies, were made, both pressed, printed,
enamelled, and gilt. The decree cut short the trade with the Continent;
but shortly after this commercial blow, which was severely felt by the
Yorkshire potters, the River Plate was opened by Sir Home Popham, a
circumstance which was taken immediate advantage of by the Ferrybridge
firm. “One of the partners immediately proceeded there, and succeeded
in establishing a good market until the royal family emigrated to
Brazil, when the same partner moved up to Rio de Janeiro, to which port
a large business was for many years carried on.”</p>

<p>The wares principally made were the following:—cream and cane-coloured
ware, in which services and most articles in general use were
manufactured, either plain, pressed (<i>i.e.</i>, with raised
patterns), painted, or printed. Green glazed ware, in which dessert
services and other articles were made, and which were of a lighter
colour than what Wedgwood produced. Egyptian black ware, of the usual
quality made at the period. Fine white earthenware, in which was
produced all the usual kinds of goods in enamelling, blue printing,
painting, &amp;c. Artists of considerable ability were employed at the
works, and I have seen examples which are of thoroughly good character,
and will vie with some of the best contemporary productions of the
Staffordshire potteries.</p>

<p>In the time of Messrs. Reed and Taylor china of a very fine quality
was made, but the manufacture was not of long duration. Tea and coffee
services, dessert services, scent bottles, and a variety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[494]</span> of articles,
were made of this body, and were remarkably good in form and in style
of decoration. Examples of Ferrybridge china are now of extreme rarity.</p>

<p>Cameos, medallions, and other ornamental articles in the time of Ralph
Wedgwood’s connection with the works, were made in imitation of those
of Josiah Wedgwood, to which they were, however, very inferior both in
body and finish.</p>

<p>The combined works at the present time (by which of course I mean the
joint manufactory of the “Ferrybridge and Australian Potteries”) give
employment to about five hundred hands, and do a large trade with
Australia and other foreign markets. In white earthenware, which is
the staple trade of the works, the ornamentation consists of a large
variety of patterns in transfer printing, in common painting, in lustre
or “tinsel,” and in sponged patterns. Enamelled and gilt goods, too,
are made, and of qualities to suit the different markets for which
they are intended. For the Egyptian markets, to which large quantities
of goods are sent, lustred or tinselled patterns are adapted very
extensively. In “jet ware,” dessert services, candlesticks, toilet
trays, and other articles are made. In this ware, I believe I am right
in saying that a large number of services have been made especially
for the Chinese market. In Egyptian black the ordinary varieties of
articles are made, as they are also in Rockingham ware. In “blue
jasper” ware, <i>i.e.</i>, a blue glazed ware, absurdly so called, many
useful and ornamental articles are made, as they are also in a variety
of other bodies.</p>

<p>The marks used at the Ferrybridge Pottery have been but few. So far as
my knowledge goes, those which will be of interest to the collector are
the following—</p>

<p class="center sm">TOMLINSON &amp; CO.</p>

<p class="p-left">impressed in the bottom of the ware,</p>

<p class="center sm">WEDGWOOD &amp; CO.</p>

<p class="p-left">impressed on cameos, made during the time of Ralph
Wedgwood’s connection with the works.</p>

<p class="center sm">FERRYBRIDGE.</p>

<p class="p-left">also impressed, and one variety of which mark is peculiar
from having the letter D reversed thus—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">[495]</span></p>

<p class="center sm">FERRYBRIᗡGE<br>

<p class="p-left">A shield, with the words—<span class="allsmcap">OPAQUE GRANITE CHINA</span>
in three lines, supported by a lion and unicorn, and surmounted by a
crown. This mark is also impressed, and occurs on green-glazed ware, as
does the one just spoken of.</p>

<p>The mark at the present time is that of the lion and unicorn with
the shield and crown, and the words, “Ferrybridge and Australian
Potteries,” sometimes impressed, and at others printed on the goods,
with the names of the bodies, as “granite,” “stone china,” &amp;c., added.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Swinton-Rockingham China.</h3>

<p>When pot-making was first practised in Swinton and its district, it
is, of course, impossible to say, but I believe that as early, at all
events (if not at a much earlier period), as quite the beginning of
last century, a hard brown ware, of much the same quality as that made
at Nottingham and Chesterfield, was produced on Swinton Common, where
clays useful for various purposes were abundantly found. In 1745, it
appears that a Mr. Edward Butler, seeing the advantage offered by the
locality through its clays, which consisted of a “common yellow clay
used for the purposes of making bricks, tiles, and coarse earthenware;
a finer white clay for making pottery of a better quality; an
excellent clay for making fire-bricks; and also a white clay usually
called pipeclay;” established a tile-yard and pot-works for common
earthenware, on a part of the estate of Charles, Marquis of Rockingham,
which lay closely contiguous to Swinton Common, where these clays
existed. The memory of this old potter, the founder of the works which
afterwards became so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">[496]</span> famous as the “Royal Rockingham China Works,”
is, it is pleasant to record, at the present day preserved in the name
of a field near the now ruined factory, called “Butler’s Park.” Butler
at these works produced the ordinary classes of goods then in use,
but principally the hard brown ware to which I have just alluded. An
interesting example of this period was in the possession of the late
Dr. Brameld, and is engraved on Fig. <a href="#image495b">866</a>. It is a “posset-pot” of the
usual form of those which, at that period, were in such general use in
Derbyshire and Yorkshire; it bears the date of 1759. This interesting
example has a fragment of a label, written at “Swinton Pottery,” which
authenticates it as having been made by, or for, John Brameld.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image495b">

    src="images/image495b.jpg"
     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center sm">Figs. 866 and 867.</p>
  </div>

<p>In 1765 the works were taken by William Malpass, who held another small
pot-work at Kilnhurst, in the same neighbourhood, and he continued them
for some years. With him were associated in partnership, I believe,
John Brameld, and subsequently his son, William Brameld, of whom I
shall have more to say presently. Mr. Malpass continued to manufacture
the same varieties of ware as his predecessor, and held the works, or
rather was a partner in them, at all events as late as 1786.</p>

<p>In 1778 Mr. Thomas Bingley became a principal proprietor of the Swinton
works, and had for partners, among others, John and William Brameld,
and a person named Sharpe. Mr. Bingley was a member of a family of that
name which had been resident at Swinton for more than four hundred
years, and is now worthily represented in the person of Mr. Thomas
Bingley, who still resides there. The firm at this time was carried on
under the style of Thomas Bingley &amp; Co., and, being thriving, indeed
opulent, people, the works were greatly enlarged, and conducted with
much spirit. An extensive trade was at this time carried on, and
besides the ordinary brown and yellow wares, blue and white dinner,
tea, coffee, and other services were made, as also a white earthenware
of remarkably fine and compact body, and other wares of good quality.</p>

<p>A highly interesting example of this period, 1788, is shown on the
accompanying engraving (Fig. <a href="#image495b">867</a>), which exhibits a two-handled
drinking-cup, with the name of one of the proprietors, “William
Brameld,” on one side, and the date “1788” on the other. This curious
cup, which is five and a quarter inches in height, is of fine white
earthenware with a bluish coloured glaze. The upper part,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">[497]</span> both inside
and out, two narrow borders round the centre, the handles, and the
base, are ornamented with blue transfer-printing. The rest of the
vessel is black, the name, date, and ornaments upon it being gilt. The
borders of blue printing are much the same as those around “willow
pattern” plates, and from this it may be inferred that the “willow
pattern” was at that period produced in Swinton.</p>

<p>From about the year 1787 down to 1800, the firm traded under the style
of “Greens, Bingley, &amp; Co.” This was consequent on some of the Greens
of the “Leeds Pottery,” (which see)—having become partners, and taken
an active part in the Swinton manufactory, with Mr. Bingley, Mr.
Brameld, and those who were connected with them in those works. Mr.
John Green became acting manager of the Swinton works, and afterwards,
as I am informed, founded the “Don Pottery.”</p>

<p>I possess some original letters from John Green, dated “Leeds Pottery,”
of April and June, 1788, addressed to “Mr. John Brameld, Swinton, near
Rotherham,” giving directions not only concerning the works themselves,
but relating to the partnership:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Should be glad you and Mr. Bingley will look over the
partnership-deeds, and if there be anything that do not meet
your ideas, please point it out. When you have done this you
may send them in a small box directed for me; they never was in
my mind when at Swinton, or should have done the needful then.
I have writt Charles with some sponges and ... informing him I
expect 4 C<sup>m</sup> kills per week exclusive of china, which I hope he
will be able to manage without increasing the wages.” ... “Hope
your buisket kill turns out well. You have room now if you will
but make neat goods and be observing to get money; but it will
require a strict attention to keep every weelband in the nick.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the same letter he speaks of consignments of flint by Mr. Brearey to
Selby and Tadcaster. He also offers Brameld from himself and partners a
commission of 5 per cent. on all “wearing apparell sould to your works.”</p>

<p>The partnership with John Green was carried on in the style of “Greens,
Bingley, &amp; Co., Swinton Pottery;” and the same price-lists which were
printed at Leeds with the Leeds pottery heading, had that heading cut
off, and that of “Greens, Bingley, &amp; Co., Swinton Pottery,” written in
its place. Later on large fresh price-lists were printed. They were
headed “Greens, Hartley, &amp; Co., Swinton Pottery, make, sell, and export
wholesale all sorts of Earthenware, Cream Coloured or Queens, Nankeen
Blue, Tortoise Shell, Fine Egyptian Black, Brown China, &amp;c., &amp;c. All
the above sorts enameled, printed, or ornamented with gold or silver.”
On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">[498]</span> the fly-leaf was a printed circular, dated “Swinton Pottery, 1st
February, 1796,” announcing an advance in prices and a revised system
of counting.</p>

<p>The patterns used at Leeds were evidently, to some extent, adopted at
Swinton; and I possess some original drawings and designs on which the
numbers for each of those works are given. For instance, in teapots,
Leeds No. 149 was Swinton No. 68; Leeds 133 was Swinton 69; 218 was 70;
and 252 was 71, and so on.</p>

<p>Late in the last century, about the time of which I am now writing,
a peculiar kind of ware was first made at these works, and took the
name of “<span class="smcap">Brown China</span>,” and afterwards that which it has
ever since maintained where attempted to be made, of “<span class="smcap">Rockingham
Ware</span>.” This ware, which is of a fine reddish-brown, or chocolate
colour, is one of the smoothest and most beautiful wares that has ever
been produced at any place. The body is of fine hard and compact white
earthenware, and the brown glaze, by which the peculiar shaded and
streaky effect of this class of goods was produced is as fine as it is
possible to conceive, and required to be “dipped” and passed through
the firing no fewer than three times before it could be considered
perfect. In this exquisite ware tea, coffee, and chocolate services,
jugs, drinking-cups, &amp;c., were produced, and continued to be made to
the close of the works in 1842. Since that time “Rockingham ware”—in
every instance falling far short of the original in beauty and in
excellence—has been made by almost every manufacturer in the kingdom,
and has always, especially for tea and coffee pots, met a ready and
extensive sale. One special article produced in this ware was the
curious coffee pot, formed on purely scientific principles, which is
usually known to collectors as the “Cadogan pot.” This curious piece
was formed on the model of an example of green Indian ware, said to
have been brought from abroad<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> by the Marquis and Marchioness of
Rockingham, or the Hon. Mrs. Cadogan, and preserved fifty or sixty
years at Wentworth before it was thought of being copied. It has a
small opening in the bottom to admit the coffee, but none at the top
and no lid. From the hole in the bottom a tube, slightly spiral, was
made to pass up inside the vessel to within half an inch of the top,
so that after filling, on the “pot” being turned over into its proper
position for table use, the coffee was kept in without chance of
spilling or escape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[499]</span></p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that tea and “Cadogan” coffee pots of genuine
Rockingham ware, the first of which was made for the Marchioness of
Rockingham, have the reputation of being by far the best of any, and
are said, I know not upon what principle, to produce a better and purer
flavour than any others.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> I have been told it as a fact, that
George IV., who was as great a connoisseur in tea as he was in many
far less harmless matters, invariably, for a long time, used one of
the then fashionable Rockingham ware pots. I have it from undeniable
authority that the royal <i>penchant</i> for this kind of ware thus
arose. When he, while Prince Regent, visited Wentworth House, the seat
of Earl Fitzwilliam, these teapots were in use, and were much admired.
On the return of the prince and suite to London, inquiries were made
for them at John Mortlock’s, in Oxford Street, who supplied the palace.
He at once saw that they would come into considerable repute, ordered
largely, contracted to have his own name stamped upon them, and enjoyed
the questionable reputation of being their inventor. Mr. Mortlock, I
believe, ordered as much as £900 worth of this ware in one season alone.</p>

  </div>

<p>In 1796, the firm was, as before, “Greens, Bingley, &amp; Co.;” and from a
list of prices and goods now in my possession, it appears that a large
variety of articles were produced. The list is thus headed:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Greens, Bingley, &amp; Co. Swinton Pottery, make, sell, and export
wholesale, all sorts of Earthen Ware, viz., Cream-coloured, or
Queen’s, Nankeen Blue, Tortoise Shell, Fine Egyptian Black,
Brown China, &amp;c. Also the above sorts enameled, printed or
ornamented with gold or silver.”</p>
</div>

<p>Among the articles in cream ware, enumerated in this list, are all the
separate items for services in Paris, Bath, concave, royal, queen’s,
feather, and shell-edge patterns, which were produced “printed or
enamelled with coats of arms, crests, cyphers, landscapes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[500]</span> &amp;c.; also
blue printed Nankeen patterns;” dishes, covers, compotiers, tureens,

fruit baskets pierced and plain, tea-trays, garden-pots and stands,
shaving-basins, salts, castors, cruets, egg-cups, spoons plain and

holy-water cup, ice pails, broad mugs, bowls, ewers, basins, &amp;c., milk
ewers, tea and coffee pots, tea canisters, chocolate cups and saucers,
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>In 1806, the firm of “Greens, Bingley, &amp; Co.” was dissolved. At this
time, as appears from a memorandum of resolutions, passed at a meeting
held on January 22nd, 1806, preparatory to the dissolution, that the
partners (present) were—“William Hartley for himself and others (this
was William Hartley, principal proprietor in the Leeds Pottery),
Ebenezer Green for himself and others (this was another of the partners
in the Leeds Pottery), George Hanson, Thomas Bingley, John Brameld, and
William Brameld.” These resolutions are as follows:—</p>

</div>

<p>At the dissolution of partnership, the whole concern fell into the
hands of two of the partners, Messrs. John and William Brameld, who,
with other partners, continued the works with considerable spirit under
the style of “Brameld &amp; Co.” until their death. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">[501]</span> old price-lists,
which I have already named, continued to be used, but had the words
“Greens, Bingley” erased with the pen, and “Brameld” substituted, so
that the heading commenced “Brameld &amp; Co., Swinton Pottery.” They
were later on joined in partnership by the younger branches of the
family, who eventually, as I shall show, became proprietors of the
manufactory. By Messrs. John and William Brameld additional buildings
were erected, and great improvements made in the ware. About this time
cream-coloured ware was made very extensively, and a remarkably fine
white earthenware—the “chalk-body,” as it was technically called—was
successfully produced, but, owing to its costliness through loss in
firing, was made only to a small extent, and is now of great rarity.</p>

<p>About the year 1813, the sons of the old proprietors, on the death
of Mr. William Brameld, succeeded to the concern. These were Thomas
Brameld, George Frederick Brameld, and John Wager Brameld, and to
them the great after-success of the works was due. These gentlemen
considerably enlarged the manufactory, made many improvements in
the wares produced, and erected a flint mill on the premises, which
after the close of the china works continued to be worked by their
descendants.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Brameld, the eldest of the partners, was a man of the most
exquisite taste, and he laboured hard to raise the character of the
productions of the Swinton Works to a high standard of excellence. In
this he succeeded to an eminent degree. In 1820 he turned his attention
to the production of china ware, and made many experiments in bodies
and glazes. Having expended large sums of money in the production
of this, his favourite project, and in making Art-advances in his
manufactory, the firm became, as is too frequently the case with those
who study the beautiful instead of the strictly commercial in the
management of their works, slightly embarrassed. This was considerably
increased by the great loss, both in earthenware and money, which
the firm sustained consequent on the war. In 1825, which it will
be remembered was a year of great commercial difficulties, Messrs.
Brameld succumbed to the embarrassments that had for some time affected
them, and a meeting of themselves, their creditors, &amp;c., was held at
Rotherham. At this meeting, Mr. Thomas Brameld produced some remarkable
examples of his china ware, the result of long and patient labour on
his part, and these being highly approved by all who were present,
and appearing likely to succeed, Earl Fitzwilliam, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">[502]</span> owner of the
property at Swinton, in the most laudable and kindly manner, agreed to
assist in the prosecution of the work by the advance of capital, and by
taking an active part in the scheme.</p>

<p>This being done, Mr. Brameld set himself to his task with renewed
spirit, and with a determination to make his porcelain at least
equal to any which could then be produced, and in this he certainly
succeeded. The works were altered and enlarged; modellers and painters,
the most skilful that could be procured, were employed; and every
means taken to insure that success, artistically and manipulatively,
which quickly followed. In this ware, dinner, dessert, breakfast, and
tea services, vases, groups of figures and flowers, and numberless
articles, both of utility and ornament, were produced, and were
all characterised by pure taste, and an excellence of design and
workmanship which told much for the skill and judgment of the mind that
governed the whole of the manufactory.</p>

<p>Mr. George Frederick Brameld, the second of the partners, devoted
himself to the strictly commercial part of the business on the
Continent. He for some time resided at St. Petersburg, a large trade
with Russia being carried on by the firm.</p>

<p>Mr. John Wager Brameld, like his brother, was a man of pure taste.
He was an excellent artist, and some truly exquisite paintings on
porcelain by him have come under my notice. He was a clever painter of
flowers and of figures, and landscapes. In flowers Mr. Brameld went to
Nature herself, collecting specimens wherever he went, and reproducing
their beauties on the choice wares of the works. At Lowestoft I
remember seeing a set of three vases painted in flowers, which, it is
said, Mr. Brameld gathered on the Dene, at that place, on one of his
visits, and which vases he presented to the father of their present
owner.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> In the same hands is an elegant snuff-box, bearing an
exquisite painting of “The Politician,” with groups of flowers, and
bearing the words, “Brameld, Rockingham Works, near Rotherham,” “The
Politician, J. W. Brameld.” This being a signed piece of John Wager
Brameld’s, is particularly interesting. Mr. Brameld’s time was chiefly
devoted, however, to travelling for the firm in the United Kingdom, and
to the management of the London house, so that his artistic productions
did not make a feature in the goods generally made at the works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[503]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Brameld, who resided at Swinton House, Swinton, a delightful
residence overlooking the valley of the Don (to whose taste Swinton is
deeply indebted for the preservation from destruction of two fine old
Norman archways from the destroyed chapel), died in 1850. He left four
sons, the Rev. John Thomas Brameld, late of Mansfield; the Rev. George
William Brameld; the late Rev. Arthur James Brameld, of New Wortley,
who was accidentally drowned soon after I made his acquaintance; and
the late Dr. Henry E. Brameld, to each and all of whom—especially the
two last named—I was indebted for much assistance in the preparation
of this notice. Mr. John Wager Brameld died in 1851, leaving an only
son, who was accidentally drowned while bathing near Swinton. The last
of the partners, Mr. George Frederick Brameld, died unmarried in 1853.</p>

<p>The regulations laid down for the keeping of time by the workmen at
Swinton, and for their guidance over their work, were remarkably well
considered and clear; the original document of about 1829, in Mr.
Brameld’s handwriting, is in my own possession, as is also another from
which I learn some particulars as to the overlookers of that time.
Richard Shillito was to have charge of the earthenware department as
general overlooker, with ... Hulme to assist him; William Horncastle
had charge of the Warehouse, &amp;c.; Mr. Wager had charge of the men at
the farm; Mr. Baguley had “charge of all the painting and gilding
department in china and enamel earthenware.” John Speight, “the
painting, &amp;c., &amp;c., in earthenware biscuit work;” George Liversedge was
overlooker and manager of the printing department; Joseph Bullough was
sorter of biscuit ware; William Speight had charge of the mill, and
also “the care of and management of all gold, colours, and glazes, &amp;c.,
he giving them out as they may be properly wanted to use.”</p>

<p>Earthenware of various kinds—“Brown China,” or “Rockingham ware,”
green glazed ware, biscuit figures and ornaments, hard fine white
stoneware, cream-coloured ware, and other varieties of goods were also
still made; and the works, which, at this time—the time when china
began regularly to be made (1826)—with the assistance of the Earl
Fitzwilliam, assumed the name of the “<span class="smcap">Rockingham Works</span>,” began
to use the crest of the Fitzwilliam family as the mark of the firm.</p>

<p>In 1826 (November 17), Messrs. Brameld &amp; Co. secured the services of
an excellent painter, “Mr. John Cresswell, painter on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">[504]</span> china,” and
articles of agreement (in my own possession) were drawn up by which
Cresswell engaged himself to them for five years at 7s. 6d. a day for
the first three years; 9s. 3d. a day for the fourth year; and 10s. 6d.
a day for the fifth year. In 1830 the firm received an order for a
service from the Duchess of Cumberland:—</p>

<p>In the same year Messrs. Brameld &amp; Co. became the purchasers from Mr.
George Green of his interest in the Kilnhurst Pottery (which see).
In 1840, Messrs. Brameld were in negotiation for the purchase from
Mr. Dillwyn of the Glamorgan Pottery at Swansea (which see); but the
purchase was not made.</p>

<p>In 1830, the Rockingham Works received an order for a splendid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">[505]</span> dessert
service for King William IV., which was executed in the highest style
of the art, and gave intense satisfaction. The original sketches for
this service are in my own possession, and are named “Original Designs
for His Majesty’s Dessert, 12th Nov., 1830, per J. W. B.” (John Wager
Brameld). They are pen-and-ink sketches by himself. Of this service
I shall have yet to speak. At this time the works assumed the name
of “Royal Rockingham Works,” and the proprietors called themselves
China Manufacturers and Potters to the King, Queen, and Royal
Family. In 1838, the manufacture of china and earthenware bed-posts,
cornices, &amp;c.—a somewhat novel feature in the art—was added to the
other productions of the Rockingham Works. In that year a patent was
taken out in the name of William Dale<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> for “certain improvements
in constructing columns, pillars, bed-posts, and other such-like
articles;” consisting of several ornamental pieces or compound parts of
china or earthenware,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">[506]</span> “united, strengthened and supported by a shaft
or rod passing through the whole length of the same, and furnished with
screw nuts or other description of fastenings, and collars,” &amp;c. These
bed-posts and other similar things were made at the Rockingham Works,
though never to any extent. They are now of very great rarity, but
examples are in my own possession. The body is white, the prevailing
colour being <i>Rose-du-Barry</i>, with yellow flowers, &amp;c. Another of
these interesting examples is white with an effective chintz pattern
in colours; while others have small groups and sprigs of flowers,
the outline in transfer printing, and filled in with colour. In my
own possession, too, are several of the original drawings of designs
for beds, window cornices, lamps, candelabra, tables, &amp;c., which are
remarkable for their elegance and beauty. An elegant work-table of this
description of ware, of simple but very effective design and excellent
workmanship, is in the possession of Mr. Wilson of Sheffield. It is 2
feet 6 inches high and 1 foot 6 inches in diameter at the top. Among
the designs to which I have alluded is one representing a small and
remarkably elegant table of somewhat similar, but much more ornate
character, on which is a fish-globe stand of corresponding design.</p>

<p>Although the Rockingham Works were eminently successful in an artistic
point of view, they were not so commercially, and in 1842 were
closed, after involving not only their noble owner, but the absolute
proprietors, in a loss of very many thousands of pounds. Only sixteen
years had elapsed since the introduction of the china manufacture to
the works, but those had been sixteen years of beauty, and of artistic
and manipulative success. No man better understood his art than Mr.
Thomas Brameld, no man laboured harder and more disinterestedly in the
ennobling of that art than he did, and few men, either before his time
or since, succeeded in accomplishing greater or more honourable things.
He and his brother looked to Art instead of commerce, and the result
was embarrassment and loss.</p>

<p>At the close of the Rockingham Works in 1842, the stock, &amp;c., was
sold off and dispersed, and the manufactory which had produced so
large a quantity of elegant services, &amp;c., was entirely discontinued.
A small portion of the building was taken by an old and experienced
workman, Isaac Baguley (formerly employed at the famous Derby China
Works), who was one of Messrs. Brameld’s best painters and gilders.
Here he commenced business in a small way on his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">[507]</span> account, and
continued to do some little business until his death. Mr. Baguley did
not manufacture the wares himself, but purchased what he required in
the biscuit and white state, from other makers, and then painted,
gilt, and otherwise ornamented them for sale. At his death, his son,
Alfred Baguley, succeeded him, and, for a few years, carried on this
decorative branch of the business on the old premises. Mr. Baguley
decorated with commendable taste earthenware and porcelain, and
produced some extremely good and effective designs in modelling, and
clever patterns in decoration. One of his specialities was the old
Rockingham ware, which he produced of a far purer and better quality
than any other house. To this branch he paid particular attention, and
produced the Rockingham chocolate or brown glaze on a china body. In
this “Rockingham china,” breakfast and tea services, tea and coffee
pots of the good old designs, drinking horns, jugs, &amp;c., were made,
and, being gilt in the same manner as the old Rockingham ware, have a
remarkably pleasing appearance, while in touch they are all that can
be desired. Mr. Baguley also made the famous old “Bishopthorpe” and
“Wentworth” jugs. His mark was the same as that of the old works—the
crest of Earl Fitzwilliam (Fig. <a href="#image516c">880</a>) with the name—</p>

     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center sm">Fig. 869.</p>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">In 1852, a small portion of the works was tenanted by
some earthenware manufacturers, who traded as “P. Hobson &amp; Son,” but
their occupation was of only short duration, and now the whole place is
closed.</p>

<p>The Rockingham Works—a view of which in their palmiest days is on
a dish made by Twigg, in my own collection—when in full operation,
gave employment to a considerable number of hands and occupied a
large area of ground.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> At the present time the place is a sad and
desolate-looking wilderness. The buildings have most of them been
removed, and others, at the time of my visit, were being taken down.
The whole place was in ruins, and in the area, where but a few years
ago all was life, activity, and bustle in the execution of a royal
order, “weeds and briars grow;” while in the centre of the wreck stood
a building bearing the almost defaced words, “This way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">[508]</span> to the China
Room,” where no china, save broken fragments scattered about on the
“shard rucks,” was to be seen.</p>

<p>Of the “brown china” or “Rockingham ware” services, Cadogan pots,
&amp;c., I have given notices. It will be sufficient to add that although
all which was made at these works were not marked, they usually bore
the impressed marks of “<span class="smcap">Rockingham</span>,” “<span class="smcap">Brameld</span>,” or
“<span class="smcap">Brameld &amp; Co.</span>,” or the name of “<span class="smcap">Mortlock</span>.”</p>

<p>In fine hard “white stoneware,” and in fine cane-coloured ware, jugs
of remarkably good design were made, and were decorated with groups
in relief in the same manner; indeed, strongly resembling, both in
body and in design, those of Turner, which are so well known to
collectors. In Mr. Davis’s and other hands are remarkably good jugs
of this kind, decorated with raised groups of figures in blue, and
bearing the embossed mark to be hereafter spoken of. The handles of
these jugs are formed of the leg and tail of a horse. In “green-glazed
earthenware,” dessert services, flower vases, garden seats, and all
the usual varieties of articles were made. The green, as a rule, was
a somewhat lighter colour and not so good in quality as Wedgwood’s.
The pieces were generally marked with the usual impressed mark. In
fine “earthenware,” services of every kind were produced, both white,
blue-printed, painted, and gilt. The glaze on the earlier pieces, it
should be remarked, is of a decided blue tint, and somewhat inferior
in quality. Some of the dessert-services produced in the early part
of the present century are particularly interesting. On each piece
is painted some flower as large as life, and coloured true to nature
in every particular. The name of the plant represented is in each
case pencilled at the back of the piece. The plants represented on
the two examples (Fig. <a href="#image508">870</a>) are respectively marked as “<i>Althea
Frutex</i>” and “<i>Virgilia helioides</i>.” In the late Dr. Brameld’s
possession was a service of this same kind, in which the flowers were
beautifully painted. The painter of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">[509]</span> pieces was Collinson, the
best flower-painter employed at the Swinton Works, and they were made
between the years 1810–15. The ware is particularly light, and has a
remarkably pleasant feel in handling. I have been somewhat particular
in speaking of this variety of goods, because similar services were
produced far more extensively at the Don Works, at Swansea, and at
other places.</p>

<p>Of works of Art, in earthenware, the Swinton Pottery produced many
vases and other objects of a high degree of excellence, both in design,
manipulation, and in decoration, and were, indeed, far in advance
of most of their competitors. Fig. <a href="#image509a">871</a> represents one of a pair of
remarkably fine <i>pot-pourris</i>, which were “thrown” at the Swinton
Works by Mr. Thomas Brameld the year he was out of his apprenticeship,
in 1805, and were, till his death, in the possession of his son, Dr.
Brameld. They are 18 inches high, and have lions’ heads for handles,
while on the top of the lid is a lion couchant, the family crest,
gilt. The jars are beautifully painted in Chinese subjects. The next
engraving shows one of the specialities of the Swinton pottery, a
“lotus vase,” from an example in Mr. Manning’s possession. It is formed
of leaves, &amp;c., and has butterflies, &amp;c., raised, as if resting upon
the leaves. The whole is carefully enamelled, and altogether forms
a flower vase of surpassing beauty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">[510]</span> It is pleasant to add that at
the close of the Rockingham Works, the moulds for the production of
these “lotus vases,” as well as others, including the model of the
keep of Conisborough Castle,<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> which, by the way, was another of
the specialities of the Swinton Works, passed into the hands of the
late Mr. John Reed, of the “Mexborough Pottery,” by whose successor
they continue to be made, both in the fine old green-glazed style, and
enamelled.</p>

<p>In “Queen’s ware,” or “cream-coloured ware,” services were formerly
made at Swinton. It was of a very similar quality to that made at Leeds
and at Castleford, and, being unmarked, is generally ascribed to one or
other of those works. In Dr. Brameld’s possession was a teapot of this
material, which is said to have been made in the latter part of last
century by his grandfather. It is here shown. It is of deep buff, or
cream colour, with beaded edges, and bears the name and date—</p>

<p class="center smaller">Amelia Hallam,<br>
1773.</p>

<p>In the late Mr. Reed’s possession, too, was a double-handled drinking
cup of elegant form, with the name <span class="smcap">Iohn Alsebrook</span>, and the
date 1795, within an enamelled border of roses and foliage, and having
on the other side a Chinese figure subject, also enamelled.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image510a">

    src="images/image510a.jpg"
     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center sm">Fig. 873.</p>
  </div>

<p>That this kind of ware was not made extensively at Swinton until after
the dissolution of partnership with Hartley, Greens &amp; Co., is perhaps
to be easily accounted for in the fact that these proprietors of the
Leeds Pottery, where it was manufactured so extensively and so well,
being also partners here, the cream ware would be made principally at
Leeds, while at the Swinton Works was produced what had not been made
at the other place. From the time the works fell entirely into the
hands of the Bramelds, however, this kind of ware became the staple
production of the manufactory, and an immense trade was carried on in
it in the Baltic and elsewhere. Not being marked, it probably often
passes for Leeds ware in the eyes of collectors. In this material
beautiful open-work baskets, and many other elegant articles, were
made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">[511]</span></p>

<p>Transfer printing was introduced at Swinton, at all events, as early,
as I have shown, as 1788, and was continued to the close of the
works. In the later years, some extremely tasteful groups of flowers,
butterflies, &amp;c., were engraved and transferred in outline, and
then painted in the usual manner. In dinner, tea, toilet, and other
services, the designs were extremely good, and one of them, the Don
Quixote pattern, became very popular.</p>

<p>Engine-turned tea and coffee pots, plates, &amp;c., were also manufactured,
and in manipulation were equal to any produced in ordinary earthenware.
Groups of flowers, figures, trophies, borders, &amp;c., in relief, were
also introduced.</p>

<p>In “china” the earliest examples are two trial pieces by Mr. Thomas
Brameld, which I saw in the possession of his son, the late Dr.
Brameld. These are a pair of small leaves, the body of which is of good
quality, painted of a salmon colour with gold veins. These are probably
of the date 1820–2, and but few trials were made from that time until
1825. In 1826 china ware began to be made largely, and from that time
(in this year it will be remembered the works changed their name from
“Swinton” to “Rockingham”) to 1842 was one series of successes in all
but profit. Tea, coffee, dinner, dessert, toilet, and other services,
were made in every variety of style, from the ordinary blue printed,
or white with raised blue ornaments, to the most elaborately painted
and gilt varieties. Vases, and numberless ornamental articles for
the drawing-room and the toilet were also made, and were generally
distinguished by good taste in design, and skill in decoration. To show
how Art was, by the taste of the Bramelds, made subservient to the
production of things of every-day use, I give, in Figs. <a href="#image511">874 to 876</a>,
three examples in Mr. Manning’s possession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">[512]</span></p>

<p>In vases, some of the finest which had ever been produced were made
at these works. At Wentworth House, the magnificent seat of Earl
Fitzwilliam, among other fine examples of Swinton Art, is one which
is of surpassing beauty. It was the largest china vase produced at
that time in a single piece in this country. It stands three feet
nine inches in height, and is three feet one inch in circumference.
The base, which is of tripod form, has a blue ground, with flowers in
compartments, and is massively gilt. From it rises the vase, supported
on three lions’ paws in white and gold. From between the feet on each
side spring branches of oak, solidly gilt, which entwine their leaves
around the paws, and form an elegant border to each of the large
painted subjects on the sides. The neck of the vase is in honeycomb
open-work, with raised bees upon it; and the handles are of massive
coral in white and gold. On each of the three sides of the vase is a
large subject from Don Quixote, exquisitely painted in enamel colours.
The cover has a blue ground, on which are flowers and trophies in
tablets, surrounded by oak leaves and acorns in gold. It is surmounted
by a large and powerfully-modelled rhinoceros, gilt. The under side
of the cover, quite out of sight except when lifted off the vase, is
painted in a series of small landscapes, alternating with subjects
taken from Bewick’s celebrated tail-pieces. Inside the cover is the
mark of the crest, and the words “Rockingham Works, Brameld,” and the
date 1826. This splendid vase was painted by John Wager Brameld. At
Wentworth House, too, the Earl and Countess Fitzwilliam have, along
with a large number of choice examples of Chelsea, Chelsea-Derby,
and other rare makes of China (which I have examined), several other
notable pieces of Rockingham china. Among these are a set of three
“Canova-shape” vases, painted with groups of flowers; a dessert-service
of white and gold “seaweed” pattern, each piece bearing the crest and
the date 1838; three of the pattern-plates submitted to William IV.
in competition for the royal service; a number of example-plates of
different designs; a breakfast service painted in flowers, each flower
named; an elegant tray with raised flowers and a view of Arundel
Castle; a pair of “monkey” beakers, nineteen inches high; and a pair
of fine biscuit scent bottles, sixteen inches high, decorated with
exquisite raised flowers.</p>

<p>In the possession of the late Dr. Brameld, who had among other things,
a remarkably beautiful ice pail and other pieces of note, was the fine
vase engraved in Fig. <a href="#image513">877</a>, which is known as the “Dragon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">[513]</span> Vase,” and
occasionally by the not very euphonious name of the “Infernal Vase.”
It is 3 feet 4½ inches in height, and has dragons for handles, and
also a dragon on the top of the cover. Another of these “Dragon” vases
is in the possession of Mr. Henry Barker. In the late Mr. Bagshawe’s
collection was a set of three vases, green and gold, with swans for
handles, on which are beautifully painted “named” views of “Bellagio,
Lago di Come,” “Verona,” and “Isola Bella, Lago Maggiore.” Mr. Reed
had pieces bearing views of Newstead Abbey, &amp;c., and in Mr. Hobson’s
possession are vases, with views of Chatsworth and other places.</p>

<p>The <i>chef-d’œuvre</i> of the Rockingham China Works was, however,
the truly gorgeous dessert service made for William IV., which is
now preserved with the most scrupulous care at Buckingham Palace,
and is, we are credibly informed, justly prized by her Majesty as
among her more precious ceramic treasures. This service, which cost
no less a sum than £5,000, consists of one hundred and forty-four
plates, and fifty-six large pieces, and is one of the finest produced
in this or any other country. The plates have raised oak borders in
dead and burnished gold running over a raised laced pattern, also in
gold, and the centres are splendidly painted with the royal arms,
&amp;c. The comports, which were all designed by Mr. Thomas Brameld,
are emblematical of the use to which each piece has to be put. For
instance, the comports for biscuit, are supported by ears of wheat;
the fruit pieces have central open-work baskets of fruit; the ice
pails are supported by holly berries and leaves; and in each case the
landscapes are also in unison with the uses of the pieces, which are
of exquisite design, and have also oak-leaf and lace decorations, so
massively gilt in dead and burnished gold as to have the appearance
of <i>ormolu</i> laid on the porcelain, and each piece is decorated
with views of different seats, the sketches for which were taken
expressly for the purpose, and by groups of figures, &amp;c. This service
is, as I have said, at Buckingham Palace. In Dr. Brameld’s possession
was the specimen plate which was submitted to, and approved by, the
king, and some portions of the comports, &amp;c.; and in Mrs. Barker’s
hands was one of the comports (with views<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">[514]</span> of “Langthwait Bridge,”
and “Kentmore Hall,” and a group of bird-catchers), which, for its
extreme beauty and rarity, is an almost priceless treasure. She also
possesses a cup and saucer of the breakfast service prepared for Her
Majesty. In Mrs. Reed’s possession is an unique example, being one of
the specimen plates submitted for royal approval in a competition with
the principal china manufacturers of the kingdom for the royal order.
In this competition, twelve plates of different patterns were specially
prepared and submitted by the Rockingham Works. Of these plates,
the examples in Mr. Reed’s, Dr. Brameld’s, the Earl Fitzwilliam’s,
Mr. Hobson’s, and other hands, form a part. In the centre are the
royal arms, and the rim is decorated with oak leaves and acorns.
Another unique pattern-plate belonged to Dr. Brameld, and is of the
most delicate and exquisitely beautiful character. In the centre are
the royal arms, and on the rim are three compartments, two of which
contain groups of flowers, and the third a view, while between these
the “garter” is repeated. The cost at which in the estimate it was
calculated these plates could be produced, was twelve guineas each.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>The dessert service made for William IV. was first used on occasion
of the coronation of our beloved Queen, and has only, I am informed,
been used on very special state occasions from that time to the
present. Although so large a sum of money was paid for it the cost of
its production was so great, that the actual outlay was, I am told
by those who are in the best position to know, considerably more
than was charged. This royal service had some little to do with the
embarrassments that caused the final stoppage of the works.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>In “biscuit,” figures, busts, and groups, as well as vases, of which
splendid examples belong to Earl Fitzwilliam, were produced. Among
other specimens that have come under my notice are a Swiss boy and
girl, a fine bust of Earl Fitzwilliam, Chantrey’s sleeping child,
Chantrey’s full-length statue of Lady Russell, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Among the artists employed at the Rockingham works it will only be
necessary to name a few. These were Collinson, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">[515]</span> painted flowers;
Llandig, who was a charming fruit and flower painter; Bailey, who
was the principal butterfly painter,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> and who also painted
landscapes and crests; Speight (father and son), the latter of whom
painted many of the finest subjects, both landscapes and figures, on
the royal service, and who also painted the heraldic decorations on
the same; Brentnall, who was a clever flower-painter; Cordon, who
executed landscapes and figures; Tilbury, who painted landscapes and
figures; Mansfield, who was the principal embosser and chaser in gold;
Aston, who was clever as a modeller of flowers; and Cowen, who was an
artist of much repute, and for many years enjoyed the patronage of
the Fitzwilliam family. William Eley, too, was employed as modeller,
and executed some admirable works, including a fine bust of Earl
Fitzwilliam.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Marks</span> used at the Swinton Works are not many, but have the
advantage of being particularly clear and easily recognised. They are,
so far as I have been able to ascertain, the following.</p>

<p>It should be premised that no mark was placed on the early productions
of these works, and they are, therefore, only to be ascertained by a
knowledge of the body, the glaze, and the style of ornamentation used.</p>

<p>The following are the marks which have come under my notice:—</p>

is a mark of great rarity.</p>

<p>It is only necessary to add to this account of the Swinton Pottery that
collectors will find remarkably good examples of Rockingham china, for
reference, in the Jermyn Street Museum, including pattern plates of the
royal service.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Mexborough.</h3>

<p><i>The “Rock Pottery” or “Mexbro Pottery”</i> is situated at
Mexborough, a rising town near Swinton, with stations on the South
Yorkshire and Midland lines of railway. The works, at first very small,
were, I believe, established for the manufacture of brown and yellow
wares, and for common red garden-pots, by a person named Beevers, who,
with a partner named Ford—trading as Beevers and Ford—carried on the
business for some years. The workrooms at this time were built close up
to the rock, which, indeed, formed the back wall of the manufactory;
and from this circumstance the place was called the “Rock Pottery,” a
name by which it is still occasionally known. The goods at this time,
and subsequently, during the proprietorship of Ford, Simpson, and
Beevers, were made entirely from native clays, and were confined to
“cane” or “yellow ware” dishes, jugs, &amp;c., for household use; garden
and root pots of red ware; and pitchers, &amp;c., of a brown ware.</p>

<p>The works next passed into the hands of Messrs. Reed and Taylor, who
also owned the works at Ferrybridge (which see), and by them were
considerably enlarged. The manufacture of finer kinds of earthenware
was also introduced by them, and carried on with great success. In
1839 the pottery passed entirely into the hands of Mr. James Reed, who
carried it on until 1849, when he was succeeded by his son, Mr. John
Reed, by whom the manufactory was conducted until his decease. It was
then carried on by his executors under the management of the late Mr.
C. Bullock. During the time of Mr. Reed’s proprietorship, and that of
his father, considerable alterations and additions were made to the
works, and new kilns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">[518]</span> erected; the character of the productions was
also much improved, and several new varieties of wares were introduced.
In 1873, Messrs. Sydney Woolf &amp; Co., the owners of the “Australian
Pottery,” at Ferrybridge (which see), became the purchasers of this
manufactory, and they now carry it on conjointly with their other works
at Ferrybridge, under the management of Mr. Bowman Heald. By Messrs.
Woolf &amp; Co. the works have been considerably extended and several new
varieties of shapes and patterns introduced. They successfully compete
in several classes of goods with any in the locality, and with many of
the Staffordshire houses. The principal varieties of goods are,—in
ordinary white earthenware,—all the most marketable varieties of
painted, printed, enamelled, and gilt services of different kinds,
many of which are of good design, manufactured chiefly for the home
market. In dinner and toilet services, especially, some remarkably good
patterns, well enamelled and gilt, are produced. In Stilton cheese
stands and covers some good designs have been introduced. In Rockingham
ware all the usual kinds of vessels are made. In “terra-cotta,” which
is of a good colour, and of a fine and durable quality, Mr. Reed
manufactured large-sized flower-vases for gardens and other decorative
purposes; pendant flower-vases for conservatories, entrance-halls, &amp;c.;
root-pots of tasteful design, butter coolers, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>In green glazed earthenware, dessert services, in which the plates,
centres, comports, &amp;c., are embossed with leaves, flowers, and other
patterns, are made, many of them from the original moulds of the
Swinton Works, which passed by purchase to the Mexborough pottery; and
others of equally elegant design from moulds expressly belonging to
Mexborough. In this ware garden seats, both plain and foliated, of the
same designs as those produced in the old days of the Rockingham Works;
and also root-pots and flower-vases, are made. Of these the “lotus
vase,” of which I have already given an engraving (Fig. <a href="#image509b">872</a>), is one of
the most elegant and attractive, and is, I believe, made only at the
Mexborough Pottery, as is also the model of the keep of Conisborough
Castle already alluded to.</p>

<p>The mark used at the Mexborough Pottery, but which is only occasionally
introduced, is simply the name of the proprietor,</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Mexborough Old Pottery.</i>—At Mexborough was formerly another
pot-work, known as the “Mexborough Old Pottery.” This was established
at the end of the last century by Messrs. Sowter and Bromley,<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> who
held the works until 1804, when they came into the possession of Mr.
Peter Barker. Peter Barker was the son of Joseph Barker, who came out
of Staffordshire as manager of the Swinton Pottery. He became partner
with Mr. Wainwright at the pot-works at Rawmarsh (afterwards Hawley’s),
and ultimately took to the works at Mexborough. These were continued by
the brothers, Peter and Jesse Barker, who were succeeded by Mr. Samuel
Barker, the son of the latter, until 1834, when they acquired the Don
Pottery. By Mr. Samuel Barker they were continued until 1844. The
Mexborough Old Pottery was then discontinued, and is now converted into
ironworks for the manufacture of wheels for locomotives. At these works
the commoner descriptions of earthenware, including blue printing, were
produced.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Rawmarsh.</h3>

<p>In the latter part of last century a pottery was carried on here by
Mr. Peter Barker and his partner, under the style of “Barker and
Wainwright.” He afterwards joined his brother Jesse at the Mexborough
Old Pottery.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Rotherham.</h3>

<p><i>North Field Pottery.</i>—This pottery was established in 1851 by
Joseph Lee, a working potter, who had previously carried on a small
manufactory (now disused) in the town of Rotherham. In 1855 it was
purchased by Mr. George Hawley, of Rawmarsh; who, on his death, was
succeeded by his sons, the late Mr. William Hawley, father of the
present proprietors, Mr. Matthew Hawley, and his two brothers. The
firm was for a time carried on as “W. and G. Hawley,” but its present
style is Hawley Brothers. The goods manufactured are the commoner
descriptions of earthenware; and a large trade is carried on in
furniture polish bottles and articles of a similar class.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Holmes Pottery.</i>—These works were built on part of the Holmes
Hall Estate—the kitchen garden, in fact—formerly belonging to
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">[520]</span> Walker family, who owned the large ironworks there, where at
one time the notorious Tom Payne worked. The pottery was at first
extremely small, but has gradually extended itself until it is now
of considerable extent. It was first worked by Messrs. Earnshaw and
Greaves, who were succeeded by Messrs. Dickinson and Jackson; it was
then continued by Mr. Thomas Jarvis until some few years back, when
it passed into the hands of Messrs. John Jackson &amp; Co., the present
owners. The goods produced are the commoner class of white and blue
printed earthenware. Some years ago an attempt at china manufacture was
made here, but was abandoned.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">The Don Pottery.</h3>

<p><i>The Don Pottery</i>, closely adjoining the canal at Swinton, on
which it has a wharf, was established in a very small way about 1790,
and considerably increased in 1800 by John Green, of Newhill. He was
one of the Greens of Leeds, of the same family as the proprietors of
the Leeds Pottery, and a proprietor in the Swinton Pottery. He is, in
fact, stated to have been the manager of the Leeds and the Swinton
potteries, and to have sustained considerable losses on the breaking
out of the French war. About 1800, or a little later, he purchased a
plot of almost waste and swampy land at Swinton, and, with the aid of
partners, set about the erection of the present works. At this time a
person named Newton, father to the more than octogenarian from whom,
some years ago, I picked up many scraps of the information I record,
had an enamel kiln at the back of his house at Swinton, where he used
to burn such wares as he decorated. To this man, for the first twelve
months, Green, of the Don Pottery, brought his pattern pieces to be
fired, as he prepared them. In 1807, other members of the family united
with John Green, who also had partners named Clarke; the firm trading
as “Greens, Clarke, &amp; Co.” In 1831, Mr. Green was proprietor of the Don
Pottery.</p>

<p>In 1834 the Don Pottery passed by purchase to Mr. Samuel Barker, of
the Mexborough Old Pottery; which latter works he closed in 1844, and
confined his operations entirely to the Don manufactory. In 1851 the
firm became “Samuel Barker and Son,” under which style it is still
continued, the present proprietors being Mr. Henry Barker and Mr.
Edward Barker.</p>

<p>From a list of goods prepared by the firm in 1808, it appears that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">[521]</span> a
considerable variety was produced at that time. This list, which is in
my own collection, is thus headed:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Greens, Clarke, &amp; Co., Don Pottery, near Doncaster,
Make, Sell, and Export Wholesale all the various kinds of
Earthenware, viz., Cream-colour, Brown, Blue, and Green Shell,
Nankin Blue, Printed, Painted, and Enamelled, Egyptian Black,
Brown, China, &amp;c., &amp;c. Also Services executed in Borders,
Landscapes, Coats of Arms, &amp;c., and ornamented with Gold or
Silver.”</p>
</div>

<p>Of the ordinary fine earthenware made soon after the opening of
the works, some specimens, whose actual date can be satisfactorily
ascertained, have come under my notice, and show to what perfection in
body and glaze, in manipulation, and in decoration, the manufacture had
already arrived. The most remarkable of these early specimens is a jug,
commonly called the “Jumper Jug,” which is of great rarity. On either
side of the larger jugs is the figure of a very uncouth, coarse, and
slovenly-looking man, in red coat, pink waistcoat, striped green and
white under-waistcoat, orange-neckerchief, orange breeches, above which
his shirt is seen, top boots, and spurs. In his hand he holds his hat,
orange, with red ribands, on which is a card bearing the words “Milton
for ever.” Beneath the spout, on a scroll, is the following curious
verse:—</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
   <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">“The Figure there is no mistaking,</div>
        <div>It is the famous Man for—<i>breaking</i>.</div>
        <div>Oh that instead of Horse and Mare</div>
        <div>He had but broken Crockery-ware,</div>
        <div>Each grateful Potter in a bumper</div>
        <div>Might drink the health of</div>
        <div class="right">Orange Jumper.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>This man, who was known all the country round as “Orange Jumper,”
was a very eccentric character, and a great mover in the political
“stirs” of his county. He was a horse-breaker at Wentworth, and many
extraordinary stories are remembered in connection with him. One of
these, as connected with the story of this jug, is worth repeating.
In the great Yorkshire election of 1807—the most costly and the most
strongly contested election on record—when the candidates who were so
mercilessly pitted against each other were Lord Milton, Wilberforce,
and Lascelles, “Orange Jumper” was employed to carry dispatches
regularly backwards and forwards from York to Wentworth House, the
seat of Earl Fitzwilliam, the father of Lord Milton, who eventually
won the election, and was returned as the colleague of Wilberforce.
Orange was the Fitzwilliam colour, and blue that of Lascelles (son of
the Earl of Harewood), his opponent; and on one occasion “Jumper” was
seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">[522]</span> entering York decked out as usual in orange, but riding on an
ass gaily decorated with bright blue ribands. On being jeered at for
this apparent inconsistency in wearing both colours, he replied that
<i>he</i> wore the right colour, orange, and that his ass was only like
other asses, for they were all donkeys that wore blue! The election was
gained by the party he espoused, and in commemoration these jugs,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
with his portrait and verse, were made. They are marked</p>

<p class="center">Don. Pottery.</p>

<p class="p-left">pencilled in red on the bottom.</p>

<p>An engraved pattern-book was issued by the firm, in the same style,
and of the same size, as that of Hartley, Greens, &amp; Co., of the Leeds
Pottery. A careful comparison of the two books reveals the fact,
that whereas in the latest edition of that of Leeds 269 patterns are
engraved, in that of the Don Pottery 292 are given. It also reveals
the important fact that many of the Don patterns are identical with
those of Leeds, the engraver of the former having evidently traced
from those of the latter (Leeds) in preparing his plates. Many of the
remaining patterns are slightly altered from Leeds, while others do not
appear in the book of those works at all. In this pattern-book Figs.
1 to 8 are covered tureens; 10 to 12 are leaves; 13 to 18, covered
vegetable dishes; 19 to 23, sauce tureens with covers, stands, and
ladles; 24, a two-handled drinking cup; 26 to 30, butter-boats; 31 to
49, dishes and plates, &amp;c.; 50 to 69, fruit bowls, side dishes, &amp;c.; 70
to 76, perforated, open-work, and embossed baskets and stands, some of
which have covers, and are precisely of the same kind as those of the
Leeds works; 77, a perforated chestnut tureen, like that of the Leeds
works; 78, also perforated and embossed; 79 to 83, perforated dishes
and plates; 84 to 91, covered sugar bowls, &amp;c.; 92 to 96, spoons and
strainers; 97 to 110, bowls, &amp;c.; 111 is a melon bowl of the same kind
as those made at Leeds; 113 to 116 are egg cups and stands; 118 to 130,
cruets, &amp;c.; 131, an asparagus holder, like the Leeds; 139 to 145, mugs
and jugs; 146, a toast rack; 147, an invalid’s feeding cup; 148 to 159,
dishes, tureens, &amp;c.; 160 and 161, vegetable trays in compartments;
163 to 176, ice pails and domestic vessels; 177 to 183, ink stands;
184, 185, flower-pots; 186 to 202, toilet services and shaving basins;
201 is a <i>scaphium</i>; 206 is a quintal flower horn;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">[523]</span> 207, a
pastile-burner; and then come candlesticks, egg-cups, flower-vases,
flower-stands, vases, crosses with cup for holy water, &amp;c. Another
series of plates, the figures numbered from 1 to 54 and from <span class="allsmcap">A</span>
to <span class="allsmcap">K</span>, are devoted to tea equipages, consisting of a remarkable
and very striking variety of teapots, coffee-pots, milk jugs, sugar
bowls, cake trays, tea canisters, basins or bowls, tea, coffee, and
chocolate cups and saucers, &amp;c., &amp;c. On each plate throughout the
series the name “<i>Don Pottery</i>” is engraved in a scroll.</p>

seals, bird fountains, smelling-bottles, and, indeed, every variety
of articles, as well as services of all descriptions, and ornamental
vases of several designs, were made in these wares, and such as were
adapted for the colour were made in green glazed ware. Of teapots, many
patterns, with raised groups, trophies, &amp;c., and others for loose metal
“kettle-handles” are also engraved.</p>

<p>In the cream-coloured ware, and also in the fine white earthenware,
excellent dessert and other services were made, and were painted with
flowers, &amp;c., with a truth to nature which has seldom been equalled. In
my own collection are also some remarkable plates of small size of fine
earthenware. In these the underside of the plate is left white, while
the whole of the rest is tinted of a deep buff. The edge, and a line on
the inner side of the rim, is black, and in the centre of each plate
is a landscape, which has all the beauty and effect of a well-executed
Indian ink drawing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">[524]</span></p>

<p>About 1810–12, <i>china</i> of an excellent quality was, to a very
small extent indeed, made at the Don Pottery, and examples of this
are of extreme rarity. In Mr. Manning’s possession is a coffee mug of
excellent body, and of remarkably good soft glaze, well painted with
Chinese subjects, which is marked “Don Pottery” in very small letters,
pencilled in red. This interesting specimen is the only marked one
which has come under my notice. Two other specimens of this very rare
china ware, which are equally curious and interesting with the one just
spoken of, are here engraved. One is a jug which will hold rather more
than a pint, and has a curious story attached to it. The china body of
which it was made was mixed by Godfrey Speight and Ward Booth, both
of whom were originally from Staffordshire; the latter, it is said,
was brought from that county “with a whole regiment of hands” to work
at the new Don Pottery, of which he became the manager. The jug was
painted by his son, Taylor Booth, who was brought up with Enoch Wood,
of Burslem, and afterwards was at the old Derby China Works, and given
to Speight, from whose aged son’s hands it passed into my own. It is
beautifully painted with groups of flowers on either side, and a sprig
of jasmine beneath the spout, and has a broad gold line round the top.
The curious part of the story connected with this jug is, that in the
body of which it is composed, by one of those strange and unaccountable
freaks to which potters as well as other people are liable, are two
of the fingers of a noted malefactor, Spencer Broughton, who was
gibbeted on Attercliffe Common at the close of the last century. It
appears that a party of the Don and Swinton potters, who had been to
Sheffield for a carousal, and had stayed there till the small hours of
the morning, were, when not sober, returning over the moor, when, on
passing the gibbet on which the gaunt skeleton of the malefactor still
hung, as it had for years, in chains, one of them, saying, “Let’s ha’
a rap at him,” picked up a stone and threw it, knocking off the bones
of two of the fingers. These were picked up, and carefully carried
home as trophies of the exploit; and some time afterwards, when trials
in the manufacture of china were being made, they were brought out,
calcined, and mixed with some of the body. Of this body a seal was
made, “with a gibbet on it,” and the jug (Fig. <a href="#image523">882</a>) just described.
This story I had from the lips of one of the party of potters, a man
then fast nearing “fourscore years and ten” in age. The horrible and
brutal taste displayed by the potters has, it must be admitted, its use
in authenticating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">[525]</span> the example, and in giving it, at all events, an
approximate date.</p>

<p>The other example is a comport (Fig. <a href="#image523">881</a>) of remarkably fine body and
excellent glaze, and has a plant of the tiger-lily exquisitely painted
of natural size, occupying the whole of its inside.</p>

<p>In fine cane-coloured ware, tea-services, jugs, &amp;c., were made, and
were ornamented with figures, borders, and other designs in relief. Of
this kind of ware the accompanying engraving of a sugar-box will serve
as an example. It is ornamented with figures, trophies, &amp;c., in relief
in black and is marked “Green’s Don Pottery.”</p>

<p>In green glazed ware flower-vases of large size, root-pots, dessert
and other services; in red ware, scent jars of bold and good design,
large-sized mignonette vases, and many other articles; and in “Egyptian
black,” teapots, cream-ewers, jugs, &amp;c., were made.</p>

<p>The “brown china” spoken of in the list of goods was the “Rockingham
Ware,” which was attempted to be made at the Don Pottery, and is still
made of the common marketable quality.</p>

<p>A considerable trade was carried on with Russia, with France and
Belgium, and with South America, to which markets the greater part of
the goods produced were consigned.</p>

<p>At the “Don Pottery” at the present day, Messrs. Barker produce all
the usual varieties of the commoner classes of earthenware to a large
extent; the works giving employment to between two and three hundred
hands. In toilet services many excellent patterns are produced, both
enamelled, gilt, and lustred. They also produce dinner, tea, dessert,
and other services, as well as all the usual varieties of goods for
home and foreign consumption, including in “Egyptian black,” teapots,
cream-ewers, &amp;c., Rockingham ware, and “cane,” or yellow ware.</p>

<p>Some of the painted patterns recently introduced are of good design,
and their pressed jugs are of superior shape.</p>

<p>The marks adopted by these works have been but few, and these only very
occasionally used. They are, so far as I have been able to ascertain,
as follows:—“Don Pottery” pencilled in red on the bottom of the
vessel, or “<span class="allsmcap">DON POTTERY</span>” impressed on the bottom of the pieces.</p>

<p class="center sm">GREEN<br>
DON POTTERY</p>

<p class="p-left">also impressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">[526]</span></p>

<p>The first of these (Fig. <a href="#image526a">884</a>) was impressed, the second (Fig. <a href="#image526b">885</a>) was
printed and transferred on the ware. It was the first mark used by
Samuel Barker, and was adopted by him on purchasing the Don Pottery on
its discontinuance by the Greens.</p>

<p>The first of these marks (Fig. <a href="#image526c">886</a>), also in transfer printing, an
eagle displayed rising from out a ducal coronet, was adopted by the
firm when it became Samuel Barker and Son, at which time the old mark
was discontinued. The eagle displayed is not now used, the firm having
adopted the old mark of the demi-lion rampant holding in his paws the
pennon, and enclosed within a garter, beneath which are the initials
of the firm, “S. B. &amp; S.” (Fig. <a href="#image526d">887</a>) On the ribbon of the garter is
usually given the name of the pottery, as for instance <span class="allsmcap">YORK</span>.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Denaby.</h3>

<p>The Denaby Pottery was established for the manufacture of fire-bricks,
&amp;c., but was, about 1864, taken by Mr. John Wardle (from Messrs.
Alcocks, of Burslem), who was shortly afterwards joined in partnership
by Mr. Charles W. Wilkinson, the business being carried on under
the style of “Wilkinson and Wardle.” The works were situated near
the railway, from which they had a siding direct into the premises.
The goods produced were the general ordinary classes of printed
earthenware, pearl body, cream ware, &amp;c., which were of good ordinary
quality. In these all the more popular and favourite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">[527]</span> patterns were
produced, and all the copper plates being new, were sharp and fresh
in appearance. Dinner, tea, coffee, toilet and other services were
produced, as well as jugs and other articles, some of which are of
really good and effective design. Yellow, or cane-coloured ware, was
also made, as well as tiles for external decorative purposes. These
were made from clay found at Conisborough, where branch works were
established. The mark adopted by the firm, for what reason it is
difficult to divine, unless it be that the wares were intended to
pass for Staffordshire make, was the Staffordshire knot, with the
words “Wilkinson and Wardle, Denaby Potteries.” These works, after an
existence of a few years only, were closed in 1869 or 1870, and the
buildings converted into bone and glue works.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Kilnhurst.</h3>

<p>At Kilnhurst, a place which one would naturally say took its name from
pot-works, is a manufactory of earthenware, known as the “Kilnhurst Old
Pottery.” This was established about the middle of last century, soon
after the Act for the navigation of the river Don was obtained. It was
erected on the estate of the Shore family. It was held at the beginning
of this century by a potter named Hawley, who had also a pottery at
Rawmarsh. From him it passed into the hands of George Green (one of the
family of the Greens at Leeds), by whom, on the 25th of April, 1832,
they were purchased by Messrs. Brameld &amp; Co. (subject to Mr. Shore, the
owner, accepting them as tenants), at a valuation, Mr. Green to retain
all the manufactured goods, copper plates, moulds, &amp;c., and to reduce
as much as convenient the stock of raw materials. In 1839 it came
into the hands of Messrs. Twigg Brothers. It is now carried on by the
surviving partner, Mr. John Twigg, who produces the usual varieties of
earthenware, and has made some unsuccessful trials in china.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Wath-upon-Dearne.</h3>

<p>The “Newhill Pottery” was established, about 1822, by Mr. Joseph Twigg,
who up to that time had the management of the Swinton Old Pottery, by
whom, in partnership with his sons John, Benjamin, and Joseph Twigg,
it was carried on until about 1866, when it passed into the hands of
Messrs. Binney and Matthews, who were shortly afterwards succeeded by
Messrs. Dibb and Coulter. In April, 1872,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">[528]</span> the works were purchased
by Messrs. Bedford and Richmond, the present proprietors. The goods
produced are the ordinary useful classes of earthenware, both for
home consumption and for export. In these all the usual services and
articles of every-day use are made, both in white, in printed (in which
some good patterns are employed), sponged and coloured varieties, and
they are produced of the usual qualities.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Wakefield.</h3>

<p>A pottery existed on Wakefield Moor in the latter part of the
seventeenth century, where vessels were made from clay found on the
spot. This clay Houghton, in 1693, calls “The potters’ pale yellow clay
of Wakefield Moor.”</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Potovens.</h3>

<p>The village of Potovens lies about two miles from Wakefield, and, as
its name implies, takes its origin from some old potteries established
at this place. Ralph Thoresby in his Diary (1702) says, under date
of March 16th, “From Wakefield then by Allerthorpe (Alverthorpe) and
Silkhouse to the Pott-Ovens (Little London, in the dialect of the
poor people), where I stayed a little to observe not only the manner
of their forming their earthenware—which brought to mind the words
of the prophet, ‘As clay in the hands of the potter, so are we in the
Lord’s’—but to observe the manner of building the furnaces, their
size and materials, which are small, and upon the surface of the
ground, confirming me in my former apprehensions that those remains at
Hawcaster-rigg (Philosoph. Trans. No. 222) are really the ruins of a
Roman pottery.” These works were carried on, about the time, or in the
time, when Thoresby wrote, by one Caleb Glover. In his will, dated 29th
of January, 1728, recorded in the Rolls Office, February 6th, 1729,
this Caleb Glover “of Pott-Ovens, pott-maker,” bequeaths to his wife
all his chattels excepting his “working tools and oven house,” and to
his son Daniel Glover he leaves all his “working tools belonging to
the trade of a pot-maker, and the pot oven.” He was succeeded at his
death, in 1728–9, by this son Daniel Glover, who continued the works.
No manufactory of the kind now exists at this place, and the name of
the village itself is somewhat ambiguous, for it is occasionally known
as Wrenthorp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">[529]</span></p>


<h3 class="smcap">Yearsley.</h3>

<p>The earliest, and, indeed, only potters of whom anything is known
at this place, are members of the Wedgwood family, as recounted in
my “Life of Josiah Wedgwood” (p. 583), where these works were first
brought into notice. One branch of the Wedgwoods of Staffordshire
settled at Yearsley, in the Yorkshire Wolds, at an early date, and
commenced pot-making, which was carried on successfully for some
generations. In 1682 John Wedgwood, of Yearsley, was “buried in
woollen,” as were also in 1692 William Wedgwood, and in 1690 Isabell,
who was wife of one of these. John, the son of this John Wedgwood, who
died in 1707, was, I have reason to believe, the John Wedgwood whose
name appears on the puzzle jug here engraved, with the date 1691. It is
in the Museum of Practical Geology, in the Catalogue of which museum is
an engraving of the opposite side from Fig. <a href="#image529">888</a>. It is of brown ware
body, coated with green lead glaze, and has, round the body, the name
“John Wedg Wood 1691. incised in writing letters.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="image529">
     <img
    class="p1"   
    src="images/image529.jpg"
     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center sm">Fig. 888.</p>
  </div>

<p>The ware made by the Yorkshire Wedgwoods was the common hard brown
ware, made from the clays of the district, and consisted, of course,
mainly of pitchers, pancheons, porringers, and other vessels of homely
kind. From researches I have made, I have succeeded in tracing out,
with tolerable accuracy, a pedigree, of the Yorkshire Wedgwoods for
seven or eight generations, ranging from the middle of the seventeenth
century down to the present time, when their descendants are still
living in the district, not as potters, but in other equally useful
walks of life.</p>

<p>So well known were the Wedgwoods of this district, that one member of
the family has been immortalised in song, thus:—</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
   <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">“At Yearsley there are pancheons made</div>
        <div>By Willie Wedgwood, that young blade.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>For this interesting fragment of a Yorkshire ballad I am indebted</p>

<p class="center sm">MM</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">[530]</span></p>

<p class="p-left">to my late friend the Rev. Robert Pulleine, Rector of Kirkby Wiske.</p>

<p>“Pancheons” are thick coarse earthenware pans, made of various sizes,
and used for setting away milk in, and for washing purposes. They are
made in several localities, and besides being sold by earthenware
dealers, are hawked about the country by men who make their living in
no other way.</p>

<p>Several fragments of brown pottery have at one time or other been dug
up at Yearsley, and, among the rest, a brown earthenware oven, green
glaze, semicircular, open at top, with a hollowed ledge round the inner
side about half way, and a flat bottom, having two handles at the
sides, and between them a crinkled ornament, bearing some letters and
the date 1712.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Wortley.</h3>

<p>The works at Wortley, near Leeds, were established in 1795 by Mr. John
Cliff, father of the present Mr. Joseph Cliff, the head of the now
firm of “Joseph Cliff and Son,” for the manufacture of fire-bricks,
for which the clay of the locality was considered highly valuable.
In 1820 the manufacture of clay retorts was commenced and continued
very largely until 1830, when it gradually died out, but was revived
about 1850 and has continued to the present day one of the most
successful branches of the trade—the retorts being considered to be
both better and cheaper than those in iron. About 1847 the manufacture
of drain-pipes was added, and these were, and still are, made at the
rate of several miles per week; blast-furnace lumps being also largely
made, and, owing to their excellent quality, extensively used. In 1866,
terra-cotta was added to the other productions of this firm and is
still carried on. About the same time white and coloured glazed bricks
were made, and now form one of the staple trades of the works, as do
plumbago crucibles, the manufacture of which was introduced in 1869.</p>

<p>The goods principally produced by Mr. Cliff are, in terra-cotta,
vases, tazzas, and pedestals; figures and brackets; capitals,
trusses, keystones, terminals, and other architectural enrichments;
flower-boxes, baskets, and suspenders; chimney-shafts, and many other
articles, some of which are characterized by extreme chasteness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">[531]</span>
design and by excellence of finish. In stoneware, tubes, pipes, and
sanitary goods of every description; troughs, mangers, and sinks;
enamelled retorts for gas, and chemical goods, &amp;c. Fire and other
bricks and tiles are also very extensively made, as are garden edgings,
fire-backs, for which a patent has been obtained by the firm. Messrs.
Cliff and Son were awarded a medal in 1862, and at the Paris Exhibition
of 1867.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Healey.</h3>

<p>A mediæval pottery existed here, in the parish of Masham, in the North
Riding of Yorkshire. Its site was on the spot where Healey church now
stands, the ground bearing the name of “Potters Field.” When the church
was erected in 1848 considerable quantities of “wasters” and fragments
of pottery were dug up by the workmen.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Colsterdale.</h3>

<p>A pottery of a similar character existed at this place on a spot called
“Potter’s Pit.” Here many vessels have been found, as well as the
clay pits which had been worked for their manufacture. The place was,
according to some old maps, a very ancient enclosure from the moor.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

also, a few years previously, thus spoken: “In Vemknoll, adjoining the
lands of Easton Pierse, neer the brooke and in it, I bored clay as
blew as ultra marine, and incomparably fine, without anything of sand,

these very patents, and to these abridgments Mr. Chaffers is indebted
for the knowledge he possessed of them. In 1864 I, too, gave notices of
these patents, four years before the date of his publication.</p>

In 1854, Mr. Binns obtained permission to exhibit specimens of his
new invention to his royal highness, whose commendations were most
emphatically and unhesitatingly expressed, and he at once purchased all
the examples which had been shown him, saying they were the best things
he had seen. Her Majesty subsequently ordered some specimens of this
work, which was all on dark blue ground; and latterly an order for a
magnificent dessert service, in the same style of work, on a turquoise
ground, has been ordered by her Majesty. The Worcester works owe much
to the pure taste of his late Royal Highness the Prince Consort.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_89" href="#FNanchor_89" class="label">[89]</a> Mr. Owen has shown that previous to December, 1765,
china had been attempted to be made in Bristol. In November of that
year, Champion wrote, in reference to some clay from Carolina, “I sent
part to Holdship, as you desired, and gave part to a new work just
established.... This new work is from a clay and stone discovered in
Cornwall, which answers the description of the Chinese,” &amp;c.; and on
December 15th, “I have had your clay tried at the works here, which is
now given up, as they could not burn the ware clean.” Probably either
Cookworthy was connected with these short-lived works, or they were
carried on under license from him.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_90" href="#FNanchor_90" class="label">[90]</a> This allusion to the time occupied in the journey from
Bristol to Plymouth is very interesting. It was then, it seems, a
hundred years ago, a two days’ journey by the “machine” (which was, of
course, the coach). Cookworthy intended to set out, it seems, on the
Tuesday morning, and hoped to reach Plymouth by the machine some time
on the Thursday. On my last journey, in fact while making these notes,
I left Bristol at eight o’clock, and arrived at Plymouth at ten minutes
after twelve, the journey occupying only four hours and ten minutes!
What a contrast between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries this
simple fact presents.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_105" href="#FNanchor_105" class="label">[105]</a> The whole of the dated examples which I have described
(with the exception of this last, which I now make known for the
first time) and those of 1765 and 1782, I fully described in the
<i>Art-Journal</i> for 1863, and they have served, unacknowledged, as
the foundation upon which Chaffers and every other later writer have
built up their notices of Lowestoft.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_106" href="#FNanchor_106" class="label">[106]</a> It is worthy of note that Mr. Chaffers, speaking upon
this, says (p. 619): “There is such a peculiarity in the form and
quality of the Lowestoft porcelain, that we are surprised any one at
all conversant with or accustomed to see collections of china could
ever mistake it for Oriental;” and yet a few pages later on he says
(p. 636), “a punch-bowl representing similar harvest scenes is in the
collection of the Author, which has been in his (Mr. Chaffers’) family
for nearly a century, painted evidently by the same artist; former
possessors <i>supposing it to be of Oriental manufacture</i>.” How is
it that, being in his own family for nearly a century, and he being
assuredly “conversant with and accustomed to see collections of china,”
Mr. Chaffers did not previously find out that it was Lowestoft, but
should have allowed his family always to suppose it to be Oriental?</p>

<p>The same writer relies in great measure on a statement made by Mr.
Abel Bly, in 1865, that “No Oriental porcelain ever came into it to be
decorated.” The statement is as follows:—“From my Father working at
the Factory I was in the habit of going daily to the premises, and can
most positively affirm that no manufactured articles were brought there
to be painted; but that every article painted in the Factory had been
previously made there. I remember that the ware produced in the Factory
was deemed far superior to anything to be obtained in the country.”</p>

<p>The statement is almost too ridiculous to notice, and how any careful
writer could give credence to it is somewhat mysterious. Abel Bly
begins his statement (which evidently was drawn up for him to sign) by
saying, “I ... am now in the 84th year of my age.... My father’s name
was Abel Bly, who was employed in various departments in the china
factory at Lowestoft. He died when I was eleven years of age.” It will
be seen that he says that, from his father working at the factory, he
was in the habit of going there daily, and so can “positively affirm”
as above, and yet his father died when he was only a little boy eleven
years old! and he was only four years old when hard paste porcelain,
according to Chaffers, <i>began to be made</i> there. I think one can
judge pretty well what amount of weight can be attached to a statement
made seventy-three years afterwards, of the internal and commercial
arrangements of a manufactory where, till he was only eleven years
old, a boy was in the habit of going daily, probably with his father’s
dinner! The statement is just as ludicrous as the next, where he says,
“I remember that the ware produced at the factory was deemed <i>far
superior to anything to be obtained in the country</i>.” Where was the
Chelsea? the Bow? the Derby? the Bristol? the Plymouth? and a host of
others?</p>

of the Leeds Pottery, to his partner, John Brameld, at the Swinton
Pottery, dated “Leeds Pottery, 15 April, 1788,” the following curious
allusion is made to him:—“Our worthy friend Ackroyd is dead, and I
doubt not but is alive again. It was a pleasant reflection to me, being
one of the pall-bearers, to think I was bearing the Cover over a dead
Carkess whose soul I had not the least doubt was in heaven. He left

<p><a id="Footnote_111" href="#FNanchor_111" class="label">[111]</a> The Act of Parliament for the formation of this line
of railway was passed in January, 1758, and it is therein stated that
Charles Brandling, the owner of the collieries, had made agreements
with the owners of the lands through which it was intended to pass, “to
pay yearly rent or other considerations” for the privilege. The Leeds
pot works must, therefore, have been established some length of time
previous to the year 1758. It may be interesting to add that by this
act Mr. Brandling bound himself for a term of sixty years to bring from
his collieries at Middleton, to a repository at “Casson Close, near the
Great Bridge at Leeds,” “20,000 dozens, or 240,000 corfs of coals,”
each corf containing in weight about 210 lbs., and in measure 7,680
cubical inches, and there sell the same to the public at the price
of 4¾d. a corf. As the town increased in size, and its manufactures
spread, fresh acts of parliament were applied for and obtained in 1779,
1793 (two), and 1803, by which last the quantity of coal undertaken to
be supplied was increased to 1,920 corfs per day, and the price raised
to 8d. per corf.</p>

<p>“<i>An Appeal to the Public from the Journeymen Potters of Leeds and
its Neighbourhood.</i></p>

<p>“It is with painful feelings that we are under the necessity of laying
before a discerning public the following brief statement of Facts
relative to those differences now existing between us and our Employers.</p>

<p>“At a time like the present, it is very strange that our Employers
should attempt an unparalleled Reduction of our Wages, amounting from
20 to 30 per cent. upon the prices we have received, when those prices
were barely sufficient to support a Man and his Family, and at the same
time raise the price of his goods to the Public at least 50 per cent.</p>

<p>“We feel confident the above Statement of Facts will at once convince
every thinking individual that our conduct in standing out to oppose
such uncalled-for proceedings is just and right. We should have exposed
ourselves to the censure of every reasonable Man, and all who have
alive in their bosom a spark of honest indignation, had we tamely
submitted to the fiat of our Employers, and not have made every effort
in our power to preserve that which is every man’s natural right—a
fair remuneration for his labour.</p>

<p>“We respectfully solicit the aid of a generous Public, to enable us to
withstand the unjust proceedings of those who have driven us to this
alternative, by their unceasing endeavours to reduce us to a state of
misery and degradation from which we hope to be preserved by your kind
assistance, and enabled to withstand those encroachments which would
inevitably plunge ourselves, our families, and our successors into
inevitable ruin.—Dec. 13, 1825.”</p>

of the tea being produced of a better quality than in the ordinary

<p><a id="Footnote_118" href="#FNanchor_118" class="label">[118]</a> The following is a copy of the agreement in my own
possession:—</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Memorandum of Agreement the 28th of February, 1838.</span></p>

<p>“Brameld &amp; Co. agree to buy from Mr. Wm. Dale, of Shelton, his interest
in a certain invention he has now in the Patent Office in London for
the manufacture of China, Ironstone China or Earthenware Pillars,
Columns or Rails, &amp;c., for Bed-Posts, Window-Heads, &amp;c., &amp;c., and for
obtaining the Patent-right of which he has entered a Caveat and taken
other preliminary steps.</p>

<p>“B. &amp; Co. agree to employ the said Wm. Dale in the manufacture of and
superintendance of the completion of the articles to be manufactured by
them under the Patent, and also in the general management of the China
Clay department at the Rockingham Works for seven years, to be computed
from the 1st of &emsp;&emsp;, this year—at the yearly salary of
Eighty Pounds.</p>

<p>“The whole expences incurr’d from this time in obtaining the proper
security of the Patent to be borne and paid by Brameld &amp; Co. at their
sole cost and risk.</p>

<p>“The said Wm. Dale to have no extra allowance above his salary as fixed
above, for the first year of his servitude. But for the second, and
each and every of the succeeding years of the term the allowance or
premium of Fifty Pounds, as a compensation for giving up his interest
in the Patent, making in the six years terminating this agreement a
total of <i>Three Hundred Pounds</i>. But it is understood and provided
that if the amount of sales of the articles made under this patent does
not, in any of the said six last years of this agreement, amount to
<i>Five Hundred Pounds</i> or upwards, at wholesale or trade prices,
<i>nett money</i>, then, in such case, the premium or compensation
for the Patent-right shall be reduced exactly in the same degree or
proportion as the sales may fall short of the amount of <i>Five Hundred
Pounds</i> in any or all the said six years of this agreement.</p>

<p>“For the considerations agreed as above to be given by Brameld &amp; Co.
to the said Wm. Dale, it is fully and clearly understood that he shall
give up to them the whole of his designs, models, and moulds of every
sort connected with the execution of the articles to be produced under
the Patent.</p>

<p>“It is also further agreed between the parties to this contract, that
if it shall turn out that the said Wm. Dale cannot from any cause
whatever substantiate his claim to, and fully secure an available and
efficient Patent so that the advantages to be expected from it shall
fail of being obtained, then, in such case, this Agreement, in every
part, shall be considered to be annulled, and to cease and determine.”</p>

<p>The specification, of which I possess a copy, was enrolled on the 10th
of September, 1838, and is accompanied by illustrative drawings.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_119" href="#FNanchor_119" class="label">[119]</a> I possess two original copper plates engraved with views
of these works in their best days.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_120" href="#FNanchor_120" class="label">[120]</a> Conisborough Castle is in the neighbourhood of these
works, being only four or five miles distant from Swinton. It is one of
the finest Norman keeps in existence.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_121" href="#FNanchor_121" class="label">[121]</a> This truly exquisite plate, which is a perfect
<i>chef-d’œuvre</i> of ceramic art-decoration, was designed by Mr.
Thomas Brameld, after the death of King William IV., and submitted to
her present Majesty, Mr. Brameld proposing to substitute it for the
plates made for his late Majesty. The Queen, however, did not give her
consent to the alteration. The cost of the substitution would, it is
stated, have been £1,700.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_122" href="#FNanchor_122" class="label">[122]</a> Services were also made for the King of Hanover, the

<p><a id="Footnote_123" href="#FNanchor_123" class="label">[123]</a> Butterflies were more frequently introduced into the
decorations at these works than at any others, and were beautifully
painted from nature. They were also introduced as “knobs” to
muffineers, sauce tureens, &amp;c., and were for that, and other decorative
purposes, charmingly modelled.</p>
